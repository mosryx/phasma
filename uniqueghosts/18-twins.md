# The Twins

## Abilities

-   The Twins are one "real" ghost and one "decoy" ghost that can interact with the environment almost simultaneously. The main Twin can provide all three pieces of evidence, while the "decoy" Twin can only give EMF Level 5 and cannot be detected with motion sensors.

-   When The Twins uses its ability, it will perform one interaction in the normal radius (up to 3 metres) and one within a larger radius (up to 16 metres).


## Activity

-   The Twins have a chance of interacting with the environment almost simultaneously, noticing two interactions occurring in very quick succession at two separate locations.

-   If players notice multiple disturbances far away from the ghost room but fail to get any response on the Spirit Box or read any significant temperature drop in the vicinity, it is a likely indicator of the decoy Twin causing disturbances.

-   Note that interactions for all ghosts happen in a radius confined to the same floor.

## Hunt Behaviour

-   When The Twins attempts to initiate a hunt, there is a 50% chance for it begin at its current location, and a 50% chance for it to begin close to the area where it last interacted using its ability.

-   Each Twin has a different moving speed during hunts. The main Twin will be 10% slower than the standard ghost speed while the secondary Twin will be 10% faster.

-   Depending on where the hunt begins from, The Twins will move at two different speeds. If it hunts from its present location, its base speed will be 10% slower (1.5 m/s), and if it hunts from the area where its "decoy's" most recent interaction occurred, its base speed will be 10% faster (1.9 m/s).

-   Crucifixes will only check for the main Twin when blocking hunts, regardless of which location the ghost is attempting to hunt from.

## Identification Strategies

-   Noticing two interactions occurring at separate locations in quick succession is a strong sign of The Twins.

-   Leaving an active EMF reader inside the ghost room while investigating elsewhere might help players identify Twins if an interaction is noticed somewhere and the EMF reader is heard going off inside the ghost room at the same time.

-   Searching around the building for items that have been displaced or thrown on the floor or lights that have been unexpectedly turned on far away from the ghost room might help narrow down the ghost type.

-   Noticing a subtle change in speed from one hunt to another might be an indicator of The Twins.

-   If there are motion sensors nearby, noticing interactions occurring in the area but without the motion sensor ever being set off is a potential sign that it is the decoy Twin.

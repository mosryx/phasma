# Poltergeist

Abilities:

-   The Poltergeist has the unique ability to throw items every 0.5 seconds during a hunt, which is more frequent than other ghosts.
-   The force value of items thrown by the Poltergeist can range from 2 to 6, which is higher than other ghosts.
-   The Poltergeist can use an ability to throw multiple nearby items at once, generating an EMF level 2 reading and decreasing the sanity of nearby players.

Activity:

-   The Poltergeist is more likely to throw items in general.
-   Turning off the lights can increase the Poltergeist's activity.

Hunt Behaviour:

-   During a hunt, the Poltergeist will always throw an item every 0.5 seconds.
-   The Poltergeist may use its ability to throw multiple nearby items at once during a hunt.

Identification Strategies:

-   Scatter multiple objects around in the Poltergeist's room and observe if one object is thrown with force across the room or if multiple objects are thrown at once.
-   If a player experiences a decrease in sanity while in line-of-sight with an EMF level 2 location, it is likely a Poltergeist.

False Positives:

-   The Poltergeist's ability to throw items can overlap with other ghosts, making it harder to discern its unique trait in smaller rooms.
-   Other ghosts, such as the Oni and Thaye, can also exhibit high levels of activity by frequently throwing items, making it important to consider other evidence before guessing it is a Poltergeist.

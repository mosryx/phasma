## Abilities

* Mares have a chance of turning off a light source immediately if a player turns one on in the vicinity. 

## Activity

* Mares cannot turn on individual light switches, computer monitors, or TVs. and they are more likely to choose turning off lights as an interaction. 

* The Mare will have decreased interaction activity if its current room is lit.

* The Mare is more likely to perform light-shattering ghost events. Whether the lights are turned on or off do not affect the Mare's chance of performing this event. Where possible, avoid staying in rooms where you want the lights turned on, so that the Mare is less likely to shatter them.

* The Mare will prefer roaming into a dark room rather than lit rooms. If you have lights on in various rooms and the ghost roams away frequently, then it could be a Mare.

## Hunt Behaviour

* The Mare has a hunt sanity threshold of 60% if the lights in its room are off, and 40% if they are turned on. This applies even if the fuse box is turned off or broken.

## Identification Strategies

* The Mare is generally one of the more difficult ghosts to identify based on behaviour. The Mare's hunt threshold in light/dark rooms is one indicator, but this can be difficult to measure and unreliable. A preference for light-shattering ghost events is another indicator, but multiple instances of this event is not conclusive evidence of a Mare. 

* The Mare will prefer moving into dark rooms rather than lit rooms when roaming, so tracking the Mare's movements may be one method of identification. Setting up motion sensors near the ghost room and turning various lights on an off while checking occasionally to see if it changed rooms may help provide secondary evidence. 

* Turning lights off in areas near the ghost room and then setting up video cameras to see if the ghost is turning lights on anywhere in the investigation area may help in ruling out a Mare. The lack of these interactions isn't conclusive proof the ghost is a Mare, but can be strong evidence. Be cautious, however, since if it is a Mare, and the lights are left off in most of the house, then the sanity threshold for a hunt will be higher.

* Attempting to trigger the Mare's ability to turn a light back off the moment a player turns it on may be one conclusive method. Pausing a few seconds between turning the lights on will help with accurately identifying this ability. 

## False Positives

* Mares do not have any special behaviour regarding fuse boxes, and can turn them on or off. Mares do not turn the fuse box off more frequently than any other ghost.

* A ghost turning on the light directly eliminates the possibility of it being a Mare. On the other hand, any ghost may choose to never turn on a light throughout the entire game, so this negative should not be used to confirm the ghost type. In fact, any ghost may turn off a light immediately after you turn it on purely by chance. Ghost events do not count for this (Mare) ability.

* Spamming the light switch will not trigger this interaction, so this is best utilised with some time between switching the lights on/off. This interaction will give off an EMF 2 reading. Note that any ghost can do so purely by coincidence. Ghost events do not count for this ability.

# Goryo

💡 EMF 5 | ✋ Fingerprints | 👻 D.O.T.S

## Abilities

-   The Goryo cannot change its favorite rooms in any difficulty level.

## Activity

-   The Goryo can only perform short roams with a maximum distance of 5 meters during a roam.

-   The Goryo will only interact with a D.O.T.S Projector if no players are in the same room as the ghost.

-   The D.O.T.S silhouette of the Goryo is only visible through a Video Camera and cannot be seen with the naked eye. The Goryo will still manifest normally during ghost events and hunts with its ghost model, which does not require any special equipment to be seen. A Video Camera must be placed facing an active D.O.T.S. Projector or held by a player outside the ghost's room to identify D.O.T.S. evidence.


## Hunt Behavior


## Identification Strategies

-   In Nightmare difficulty, the Goryo will always have the D.O.T.S. Projector as one of its two pieces of evidence, which is the only trait that can distinguish it from other ghost types.

-   If D.O.T.S evidence is visible in the camera's screen but invisible in direct view, the ghost is likely to be a Goryo. If D.O.T.S is seen without the aid of a video camera, a Goryo can be safely ruled out.

-   In rare cases, players can see D.O.T.S. while they are in the same room, indicating that the Goryo only requires no players in the same room with it to interact with the projector. The projector's interaction radius is 7 meters, stretching almost the entire length of 6 Tanglewood Drive, enabling these sorts of scenarios.







-   Turning up device or in-game brightness may help when trying to rule out a Goryo.

-   The power of the Goryo only affects its silhouette with the D.O.T.S. Projector.
-   The Goryo should not be ruled out simply because it has manifested during ghost events or hunts.
-   If D.O.T.S. Projector is not obtained as one of the ghost's two pieces of evidence on Nightmare difficulty or on a limited evidence custom game, then the Goryo can be safely ruled out.
-   A Goryo cannot show up through D.O.T.S. on a 0 evidence run, making the ghost hard to identify with certainty, with its only feature being a generally shorter roaming distance.

### Unique Identifiers

* Goryo will always give 👻 D.O.T.S.

* A Goryo will only interact with a D.O.T.S Projector if no players are in the same room as the ghost. 

* A Goryo D.O.T.S silhouette is only visible through a Video Camera, and cannot be seen with the naked eye. It will still manifest normally during ghost events and hunts.

* The Goryo will never change its favorite room, even when the difficulty allows for it.

* When performing a roam, the maximum distance that a Goryo can roam in one go is 5 metres, instead of the standard maximum of 10 metres. 

### Strategies

* It is necessary to have a Video Camera either placed facing an active D.O.T.S. Projector, or held by a player outside the ghost's room. If D.O.T.S. evidence is visible in the camera's screen, but invisible in direct view, the ghost is likely to be a Goryo. Conversely, if D.O.T.S. is seen without the aid of a video camera, a Goryo can be safely ruled out.

* The Goryo is less likely to wander far distances. If ghost activity seems relatively confined to its room and the immediate vicinity (excluding ghost events and hunts), then it could be a Goryo.

# Shade

üí° EMF 5 | üå°Ô∏è Freezing | üñäÔ∏è Writing

Abilities:

-   The Shade is less likely to perform interactions than other ghosts on average.
-   It has a higher chance of performing "ghost mist" ghost events rather than manifestations.
-   If it does manifest, it has a higher chance of appearing as a shadow.
-   It can only hunt below an average sanity of 35%.

Activity:

-   The Shade is less likely to perform ghost events at high sanities, with a 0% chance of success at 100% average sanity.
-   Its success rate for performing ghost events increases by 2% per percentage of average sanity lost.
-   If the Shade is made to appear using a Summoning Circle or a Music Box, it has a chance of appearing as a black shadow rather than in its full form while in the ghost event stage.

Hunt Behavior:

-   If at least one person is in the same room as a Shade, it will be unable to perform regular interactions (except Ghost Writing) or initiate a hunt.
-   The Shade can only hunt below an average sanity of 35%.

Identification Strategies:

-   Keeping everyone out of the ghost room and using smudge sticks or specific cursed possessions may increase the chance of the ghost interacting with the environment.
-   Turning off the lights in the ghost's room may also help.
-   In Nightmare difficulty, the Shade can be identified by lowering the average sanity close to zero and having players stand in the ghost's current room and rooms directly adjacent. If it refuses to hunt or hunts only from a room without players, then it may be a Shade.
-   In singleplayer on Nightmare difficulty, the Shade can be identified by dropping the average sanity to zero, using two sanity pills to restore the player's sanity to 50%, and allowing a small drop of sanity for a few seconds within the investigation area before stopping it via candles or room lights. A ghost that refuses to hunt at this sanity may indicate that the ghost is a Shade.
-   The Shade appearing as a shadow in the summoning circle is not guaranteed, so seeing a full manifestation does not rule out a Shade.

# Shade	
### Unique Identifiers
* Shade cannot hunt above 35%. 

* Shades will not perform interactions or hunt if there is a player in the same room. 

    * This ability may be bugged and throw false positives. 

    * It can still perform ghost writing while in the same room as one or more players. 

    * It is possible for the Shade to wander out of its room, before performing these actions.

### Possible Identifiers
* Shades have a lower success rate for ghost events. If the ghost performs a ghost event while average sanity is still high, then it is less likely (though not impossible) to be a Shade.

* Shades prefer airball ghost events over manifesting. 

* If it does manifest, it will prefer (though not always use) the shadow-type ghost form.

* If summoned by a Summoning Circle or a Music Box, the Shade has a chance of appearing as a shadow instead of a fully visible form while in the "ghost event" state.

### Ghost Hunt Conditions

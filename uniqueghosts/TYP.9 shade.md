# Shade

üí° EMF 5 | üå°Ô∏è Freezing | üñäÔ∏è Writing

## Abilities

-   If at least one person is in the same room as a Shade, it will be unable to perform interactions (except Ghost Writing) or initiate a hunt.

## Activity

-   The Shade is less likely to perform ghost events at high sanities, with a 0% chance of success at 100% average sanity. Its success rate for performing ghost events increases by 2% per percentage of average sanity lost.

-   The Shade is less likely to perform interactions than other ghosts on average.

-   It has a higher chance of performing "ghost mist" ghost events rather than manifestations. If it does manifest, it has a higher chance of appearing as a shadow.

## Hunt Behavior

* Shade cannot hunt above 35%. 

- The Shade will not initiate a hunt if one or more players are currently in the same room. 


## Identification Strategies

-   Keeping everyone out of the ghost room and using smudge sticks or specific cursed possessions may increase the chance of the ghost interacting with the environment.

-   In Nightmare difficulty, the Shade can be identified by lowering the average sanity close to zero and having players stand in the ghost's current room and rooms directly adjacent. If it refuses to hunt or hunts only from a room without players, then it may be a Shade.

-   In singleplayer on Nightmare difficulty, the Shade can be identified by dropping the average sanity to zero, using two sanity pills to restore the player's sanity to 50%, and allowing a small drop of sanity for a few seconds within the investigation area before stopping it via candles or room lights. A ghost that refuses to hunt at this sanity may indicate that the ghost is a Shade.

## False Positives

-   The Shade appearing as a shadow in the summoning circle is not guaranteed, so seeing a full manifestation does not rule out a Shade.

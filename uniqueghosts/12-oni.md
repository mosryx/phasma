# Oni

💡 EMF 5 | 🌡️ Freezing | 👻 D.O.T.S

## Abilities

-   Double the sanity drain (20%) of other ghosts when colliding with the target player during a ghost event

## Activity

-   More active on average, interacting with objects more often, especially when there are people in the ghost room

* Oni will never appear as ball of mist during ghost event and will prefer to manifest in its full form. It can still perform events that can cause a hiss, such as "fake hunt" type manifestations.

## Hunt Behaviour

-   Flash visible for longer than most other ghosts during a hunt, making it easier to take a photo of.

## Identification Strategies

* Onis will drain double the normal sanity amount during a ghost event (20% instead of 10%). Noticing a player that has witnessed one or more ghost events and experienced a higher sanity drop than expected is a good sign of an Oni.

-   Rule out if the ghost performs a "ghost mist" event, but note that it can still hiss as part of a manifestation event

-   May readily give up evidence to players, leading to generous and swift investigations

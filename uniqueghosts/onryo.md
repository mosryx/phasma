# Onryo

Abilities:

-   Onryo frequently blows out sources of flame (lit candle, lighter, or campfire) more than other ghosts.
-   Every third flame that the Onryo blows out will cause it to attempt to initiate a hunt, regardless of current average sanity.
-   Flames can prevent or cause a hunt. If the Onryo attempts a hunt within 4 meters of any type of flame, it will blow out the flame instead, and the hunt will fail. However, if a flame is blown out during a hunt, it will count towards the three-flame rule.
-   Onryo has a hunt sanity threshold of 60%, which is higher than the standard 50% baseline.
-   Flames do not make the Onryo more likely to leave a room.

Activity:

-   Onryo can blow out multiple flames in quick succession, increasing the risk of a hunt.
-   In Sunny Meadows, several lit candles can be found in the chapel, which ghosts can blow out. If the ghost is located there and hunts very early (and is otherwise not a Demon), then it may be an Onryo.

Hunt Behavior:

-   Onryo's hunt behavior can be prevented by normal prevention methods (e.g., a crucifix) or another flame.
-   There can be a delay of up to ~6 seconds before the hunt actually initiates.
-   If both a crucifix and a flame are within range, the flame will take priority over the crucifix for preventing the hunt.

Identification Strategies:

-   Place one crucifix in the ghost's area, then a candle directly on top.
-   Place two crucifixes in the ghost's area, then multiple candles spread out and covering the crucifixes' ranges.
-   If the crucifix is activated without the candles going out first, then it is not an Onryo.
-   If the ghost seems to not hunt with multiple candles active or hunts in an area where no candles are lit, then it may be an Onryo.
-   Onryo's aversion to fire may be kept from hunting indefinitely with sufficient candles and diligent relighting of them whenever they're extinguished.

False Positives:

-   None mentioned.

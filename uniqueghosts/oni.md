# Oni

Abilities:

-   Double the sanity drain (20%) of other ghosts when colliding with the target player during a ghost event
-   Will prefer showing in its full form during a manifestation event as opposed to a shadowy or translucent form
-   Cannot perform the "ghost mist" event, but can still perform events that can cause a hiss, such as "fake hunt"-type manifestations

Activity:

-   More active on average, interacting with objects more often, especially when there are people in the ghost room

Hunt Behaviour:

-   Flash visible for longer than most other ghosts during a hunt, making it easier to take a photo of

Identification Strategies:

-   Look for evidence of increased activity and interaction with objects
-   Rule out if the ghost performs a "ghost mist" event, but note that it can still hiss as part of a manifestation event
-   May readily give up evidence to players, leading to generous and swift investigations

False Positives:

-   None mentioned in the provided text.

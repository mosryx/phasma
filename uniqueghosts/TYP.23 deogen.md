## Deogen

üîä Spirit Box | üñäÔ∏è Writing | üëª D.O.T.S

### Unique Identifiers

* Deogen will always give üîäSpirit Box.

* The Deogen's hunt sanity threshold is 40%. 

* When the Deogen is chasing a player, Deogen will move very fast when far away from the player (3 m/s when more than 6 meters away), and then incredibly slowly when it gets close to the player (0.4 m/s when closer than 2.5 meters). 

### Possible Identifiers

* The Deogen is more likely to interact with the D.O.T.S Projector and Ghost Writing Book, and on average will write in a book earlier than other ghosts, and show up more often as a silhouette on the D.O.T.S Projector.

* When using the spirit box when the Deogen is very close by, it has a 33% chance with each question to produce a unique response of constant heavy [bull-like breathing](https://youtu.be/Zm2w4X-TU2c).

### Hunt Behaviour

* The Deogen can see all the players on the map at all times during hunt. 

* When the hunt begins, the Deogen will pick the nearest player (by straight-line distance) to move towards. It will occasionally "refresh" and repick the nearest target throughout the hunt. 
    
* Using a Smudge Stick will stun the Deogen temporarily and force it to pick the nearest target when the smudge effect runs out. Its speed will remain at its current speed when smudged.

* The Deogen flashes invisible for shorter than the standard 0.3 to 1 second range during a hunt, meaning it will be visible for longer than a usual ghost.

### Strategies

* The most straightforward form of identification is for the ghost to hunt. If it approaches the nearest player at high speeds and slows down drastically as it approaches, then it is a Deogen. 

    * Note that a "young" Thaye, a Revenant that has detected someone, and a Hantu when the power has been out for a while and room temperatures are at their lowest, may move at similar speeds, but without slowing down drastically (if at all); mistaking them for a Deogen can be deadly. 

* A non-hunt way would be to constantly track the ghost and look for the signature heavy breathing through the spirit box, though this will be more tedious.

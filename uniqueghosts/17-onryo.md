# Onryo

üîÆ Ghost Orb | üîä Spirit Box | üå°Ô∏è Freezing

## Abilities

* Flames act like crucifix for Onryo (candles, lighter, Maple Lodge Campsite campfire). If Onryo tries to hunt with a flame source nearby, it will blow out the flame instead. 


## Activity

-   Onryo frequently blows out sources of flame (lit candle, lighter, or campfire) more than other ghosts.


## Hunt Behavior

-   The Onryo has a 60% hunt sanity threshold.

-   If the Onryo attempts a hunt within 4 meters of any type of flame, it will blow out the flame instead, and the hunt will fail. However, if a flame is blown out during a hunt, it will count towards the three-flame rule.

-   There can be a delay of up to ~6 seconds before the hunt actually initiates.

-   Both flames and crucifixes can prevent hunts. If both a flame and crucifix are within range when Onryo attempts to hunt, it will choose to blow out the flame. 


## Identification Strategies

-   In Sunny Meadows, several lit candles can be found in the chapel, which ghosts can blow out. If the ghost is located there and hunts very early (and is otherwise not a Demon), then it may be an Onryo.

-   Place a crucifix down, and having multiple lit candles in close proximity; if the candles repeatedly go out without the ghost ever hunting nor the crucifix ever burning, even at low average sanity, the ghost may be an Onryo. On the other hand, if the crucifix burns without any nearby candle being extinguished, the ghost is not an Onryo.

-   If the ghost seems to not hunt with multiple candles active or hunts in an area where no candles are lit, then it may be an Onryo.

-   Onryo's aversion to fire may be kept from hunting indefinitely with sufficient candles and diligent relighting of them whenever they're extinguished.

-   Flames do not make an Onryo more likely to leave a room. 

# False Positives

* Onryo share three evidence with Mimic (including Mimic's fake Ghost Orbs as one) making them very east to misidentify for eachother. There is also a chance that the Mimic will copy Onryo's unique abilities, making it even more dangerous to misidentify. If you find fingerprints at any point, then it cannot be Onryo.

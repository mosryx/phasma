# Thaye	

## Abilities

* The Thaye has an "age" parameter that decreases its general activity. Every 1 to 2 minutes, the Thaye attempts to age; if at least one player is in the same room as the ghost, the Thaye will age, else it will wait another 30 seconds before attempting to age again. The Thaye can age a total of 10 times per contract.

* Over time, the age given when asked for via the Ouija Board will increase. The Thaye does not have to start from a "young" age human-wise.

## Activity

* Thaye will tend to be much more active early on and then gradually become less active as the investigation goes on. 

* The Thaye is more likely to interact with the D.O.T.S Projector and Ghost Writing Book. If the ghost is slow to appear on the D.O.T.S Projector or give Ghost Writing, a Thaye is less likely.

## Hunt Behavior

* Thaye will start off at 75% sanity required to hunt. This percentage will go down by 5% every time the Thaye ages until it reached 15% required sanity. 

* The Thaye does not speed up with line-of-sight of a player. 

## Identification Strategies

* If the ghost is fast early in the contract, slows down over several hunts as players continue spending time near it, and does not gain speed with line-of-sight, then a Thaye is likely.

* On Nightmare difficulty, obtaining Ghost Writing and D.O.T.S Projector confirms the ghost as a Thaye, since the only other ghost that has these two evidences is the Deogen, which has Spirit Box as a guaranteed evidence.

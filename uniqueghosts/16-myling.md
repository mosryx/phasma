# Myling

üí° EMF 5 | ‚úã Fingerprints | üñäÔ∏è Writing

## Activity

-   The Myling is more likely to produce frequent paranormal sounds, which can be heard through a Parabolic Microphone.

## Hunt Behaviour

-   During a hunt, the Myling's footstep and vocalization sounds will only be audible to players within 12 meters, slightly greater than the range required for electronic interference, instead of the usual 20 meters. The volume of the Myling's footsteps is slightly muffled near the limit, but becomes more discernible as it approaches.

## Identification Strategies

-   In order to detect the Myling's unique sounds during a hunt the ghost must be on the same floor as the player. If footsteps and ghost vocalizations are audible only when electrical equipment starts flickering, the ghost is likely a Myling.

-   There may be occasional bugs where the ghost temporarily does not flicker electronics on the correct floor when changing floors.

-   The audio threshold for the Myling is slightly greater than the interference range, which means some audio setups may allow players to hear footsteps before electronics flicker.

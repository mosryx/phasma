## Wraith	

### Unique Identifiers

* Wraiths will never step in salt, though they can walk over them without leaving any imprint. 

    * **Wraith Test:** If the ghost leaves an imprint in a salt pile, you can eliminate the Wraith.

    * Similarly, if the ghost never steps in salt after a long time, then it is likely for it to be a Wraith.

### Possible Identifiers

* Wraiths can teleport to a player outside hunts, generating an EMF Level 2 or 5 reading. If there is no other interaction nearby that would have caused an EMF 2/5 reading, it is possible that the ghost is a Wraith. If the ghost is suddenly in an area it isn't expected, such as far from the ghost room, it may be a Wraith.

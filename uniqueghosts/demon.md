## Demon	

üå°Ô∏è Freezing | ‚úã Fingerprints | üñäÔ∏è Writing

## Activity

* The Demon has an interaction range of 5 metres instead of 3.

* The effective range of a crucifix is 5 meters instead of the standard 3 meters.

## Hunt Behavior

* The Demon has a hunt sanity threshold of 70%, instead of the standard 50%. This does not affect and is independent from its hunt ability, although the hunt does not differ in any way.

* The Demon has an ability that allows it to start a hunt regardless of current average sanity. Crucifixes can block this hunt like any other non-cursed hunt.

* Demons have a minimum cooldown of 20 seconds between hunts, instead of the usual 25 seconds.

* Smudging a Demon will prevent hunts for only 60 seconds, as opposed to the standard 90 seconds.

## Identification Strategies

* Having a lazily placed crucifix burn when the ghost would normally not have used it may indicate a Demon, though ghosts could happen to wander away from their room into the crucifix's range

* A crucifix being used while still on the van wall on 42 Edgefield Road is almost certainly a Demon (usually in the garage)

* A cooldown of less than 25 seconds (excluding hunts caused by cursed possessions) may indicate a Demon.

* A ghost hunting between 60 - 90 seconds after being smudged correctly may indicate a Demon.

    * Note that ghosts do not necessarily hunt after the cooldown is over; having hunts consistently being more than 25 seconds apart do not necessarily eliminate the Demon as a possibility.

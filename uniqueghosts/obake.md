# Obake

Abilities:

-   The Obake ghost has a 75% chance of leaving fingerprints when it interacts with a valid surface, but this chance is not always guaranteed.
-   The Obake has a 1/15 (6.67%) chance of shapeshifting into a different ghost model of the same gender every time it flickers during a hunt.
-   The Obake can occasionally trigger an ability to reduce the remaining time for all existing, lingering fingerprints on the map by half, making it possible for a fingerprint to last for mere seconds.

Activity:

-   There are no unique activities associated with the Obake ghost.

Hunt Behaviour:

-   During a hunt, the Obake has a 1/15 (6.67%) chance of shapeshifting into a different ghost model of the same gender every time it flickers. This is guaranteed to happen at least once per hunt.
-   Dead players cannot see the shapeshift.

Identification Strategies:

-   If an Obake is suspected, checking a touched surface with a UV Flashlight or Glowstick each time it interacts with a door or the like is prudent to spotting the Obake's special fingerprints.
-   On limited evidence games, an Obake will always have Fingerprints as one of its evidence types.
-   If the ghost touches a surface and leaves no fingerprints, then later leaves fingerprints on another surface, or vice versa, this usually points to the ghost being an Obake.
-   If you are on a zero-evidence run, the Obake will never produce fingerprints, and hence can only be identified by spotting its shapeshifting power during a hunt.

False Positives:

-   Although the Obake has a 75% chance to leave fingerprints evidence, it is still possible for it to seem as if it were another ghost with fingerprints by sheer probability.
-   It's also possible for an Obake to interact with nearby doors frequently enough that it may be very difficult to single it out by its ability to quickly decay its fingerprints.

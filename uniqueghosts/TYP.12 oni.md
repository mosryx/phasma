# Oni

üí° EMF 5 | üå°Ô∏è Freezing | üëª D.O.T.S

Abilities:

-   Double the sanity drain (20%) of other ghosts when colliding with the target player during a ghost event
-   Will prefer showing in its full form during a manifestation event as opposed to a shadowy or translucent form
-   Cannot perform the "ghost mist" event, but can still perform events that can cause a hiss, such as "fake hunt"-type manifestations

Activity:

-   More active on average, interacting with objects more often, especially when there are people in the ghost room

Hunt Behaviour:

-   Flash visible for longer than most other ghosts during a hunt, making it easier to take a photo of

Identification Strategies:

-   Look for evidence of increased activity and interaction with objects
-   Rule out if the ghost performs a "ghost mist" event, but note that it can still hiss as part of a manifestation event
-   May readily give up evidence to players, leading to generous and swift investigations

## Oni	
**Required Sanity:** Standard

**Speed:** Standard


### Unique Identifiers
* Oni will never appear as ball of mist during ghost event. 

* Oni will have shorter blinks during hunts and will remain mostly visible. 

### Possible Identifiers
* During ghost events, the Oni is more likely to use its full ghost model rather than a shadow or a translucent form.

* Onis will drain double the normal sanity amount during a ghost event (20% instead of 10%). Noticing a player that has witnessed one or more ghost events and experienced a higher sanity drop than expected is a good sign of an Oni.

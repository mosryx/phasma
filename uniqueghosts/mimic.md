# The Mimic

Abilities:

-   The Mimic can imitate any type of ghost and copy its features and abilities, including interaction and ghost event rates, hunt thresholds, and hunt movement speeds.
-   It can also copy features of evidence of mimicked ghost types but not their evidences themselves.
-   The Mimic provides evidence of Ghost Orbs in addition to its three main evidence types.

Activity:

-   The Mimic will change the ghost type it chooses to imitate every 30 seconds to 2 minutes, but cannot change during hunts.



Hunt Behaviour:

-   The Mimic can theoretically have the powers of almost any ghost type at any time, most notably ghost abilities that could enable early hunts.
-   It is prudent to have Smudge Sticks handy, as The Mimic may imitate fast ghosts such as the Revenant or Thaye, or most dangerously imitate the Deogen and require hunters to completely change up their strategy from hiding to looping between hunts, potentially after everyone is already situated at a hiding spot.

Identification Strategies:

-   The presence of Ghost Orbs with The Mimic means that players have to take care when trying to identify the ghost with three pieces of evidence.

-   Players should confirm or eliminate the presence of a fourth evidence to distinguish the Mimic from other ghosts it imitates.

False Positives:

-   None. The Mimic can imitate any ghost but has unique features that distinguish it from all other ghosts.

# Onryo

üîÆ Ghost Orb | üîä Spirit Box | üå°Ô∏è Freezing

Abilities:

-   Onryo frequently blows out sources of flame (lit candle, lighter, or campfire) more than other ghosts.
-   Every third flame that the Onryo blows out will cause it to attempt to initiate a hunt, regardless of current average sanity.
-   Flames can prevent or cause a hunt. If the Onryo attempts a hunt within 4 meters of any type of flame, it will blow out the flame instead, and the hunt will fail. However, if a flame is blown out during a hunt, it will count towards the three-flame rule.
-   Onryo has a hunt sanity threshold of 60%, which is higher than the standard 50% baseline.
-   Flames do not make the Onryo more likely to leave a room.

Activity:

-   Onryo can blow out multiple flames in quick succession, increasing the risk of a hunt.
-   In Sunny Meadows, several lit candles can be found in the chapel, which ghosts can blow out. If the ghost is located there and hunts very early (and is otherwise not a Demon), then it may be an Onryo.

Hunt Behavior:

-   Onryo's hunt behavior can be prevented by normal prevention methods (e.g., a crucifix) or another flame.
-   There can be a delay of up to ~6 seconds before the hunt actually initiates.
-   If both a crucifix and a flame are within range, the flame will take priority over the crucifix for preventing the hunt.

Identification Strategies:

-   Place one crucifix in the ghost's area, then a candle directly on top.
-   Place two crucifixes in the ghost's area, then multiple candles spread out and covering the crucifixes' ranges.
-   If the crucifix is activated without the candles going out first, then it is not an Onryo.
-   If the ghost seems to not hunt with multiple candles active or hunts in an area where no candles are lit, then it may be an Onryo.
-   Onryo's aversion to fire may be kept from hunting indefinitely with sufficient candles and diligent relighting of them whenever they're extinguished.

False Positives:

-   None mentioned.


## Onryo	
### Unique Identifiers
* Flames act like crucifix for Onryo (candles, lighter, Maple Lodge Campsite campfire). If Onryo tries to hunt with a flame source nearby, it will blow out the flame instead. 

* If Onryo tried to hunt with both a flame and a crucifix nearby, it will always favor blowing out flame. 

  * **Test:** Place a crucifix down, and having multiple lit candles in close proximity; if the candles repeatedly go out without the ghost ever hunting nor the crucifix ever burning, even at low average sanity, the ghost may be an Onryo. On the other hand, if the crucifix burns without any nearby candle being extinguished, the ghost is not an Onryo.

### Possible Identifiers
* The Onryo has a 60% hunt sanity threshold.

* Every third candle that the Onryo blows out will also cause it to hunt. This ability will trigger a hubt at any sanity. At high sanity, if the ghost hunts within a few seconds after blowing out your candle, then it could be an Onryo.

* Mimic can sometimes be mistaken for Onryo. Get fingerprints to rule out a Mimic.

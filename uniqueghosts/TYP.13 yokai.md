## Activity

* Continuously talking near a Yokai will increase the chance of interactions taking place.

## Hunt Behaviour

* While players are talking near the Yokai, its hunt sanity threshold will be increased to 80%, else it will have the normal 50% threshold.

* During hunts, a Yokai can only sense voices and electronics within a 2.5-meter range.

## Identification Strategies

- If ghost appears to lose track of the player easily during hunts, such as weird doubling back while kiting around car in garage, could indicate a Yokai.

- If you use a Music Box to start a hunt and ghost starts to hunt from very close, could indicate a Yokai.

# Myling

-   Abilities:

-   The Myling produces paranormal sounds more frequently than other ghosts, and these sounds can only be heard through a Parabolic Microphone.
-   During a hunt, the Myling's footstep and vocalization sounds will only be audible to players within 12 meters, slightly greater than the range required for electronic interference, instead of the usual 20 meters.
-   The volume of the Myling's footsteps is slightly muffled near the limit, but becomes more discernible as it approaches.

Activity:

-   The Myling is more likely to produce frequent paranormal sounds, which can be heard through a Parabolic Microphone.

Hunt Behaviour:

-   Before a hunt, players can drop a flashlight or any obvious electric equipment that flickers within range in their hiding spot to test if the ghost is a Myling.
-   During a hunt, players should pay attention to the following:
    -   The ghost must be on the same floor as the player.
    -   If footsteps and ghost vocalizations are audible only when electrical equipment starts flickering, the ghost is likely a Myling.
-   There may be occasional bugs where the ghost temporarily does not flicker electronics on the correct floor when changing floors.
-   The audio threshold for the Myling is slightly greater than the interference range, which means some audio setups may allow players to hear footsteps before electronics flicker.

Identification Strategies:

-   Use a Parabolic Microphone to listen for frequent paranormal sounds, which may indicate the presence of a Myling.
-   Drop a flashlight or other flickering electrical equipment in the hiding spot before a hunt to test if the ghost is a Myling.
-   Pay attention to the audio cues during a hunt, including the range of audible footsteps and vocalizations.

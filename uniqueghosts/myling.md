# Myling

-   The Myling ghost produces paranormal sounds more frequently than other ghosts.
-   When hunting, a Myling's footsteps and vocalizations are only audible to players within 12 meters, slightly greater than the range required for electronic interference.
-   The volume of the footsteps is slightly muffled near the limit, but becomes more discernible as it approaches.
-   Idle ghost's paranormal sounds can only be heard through a Parabolic Microphone, which can help players determine if the ghost is a Myling.
-   Before a hunt, drop a flashlight or any electrical equipment that flickers within range in your hiding spot.
-   During a hunt, look out for footsteps and ghost vocalizations that are audible only when your electrical equipment starts flickering to determine if the ghost is a Myling.
-   Note that there may be an occasional bug where the ghost temporarily does not flicker electronics on the correct floor when changing floors.
-   Audio setups with high volume or specific equalizer settings may allow you to hear footsteps before electronics flicker.
-   It is not advisable to draw any conclusions if the ghost is on a different floor because the audio will be muffled considerably.
-   An audio setup of fair quality or turning up the volume may improve the accuracy of the test.

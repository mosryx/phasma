# Yurei	

### Unique Identifiers

* The Yurei can drop the sanity of all players within 7.5 meters by 15% while also closing a door sharply at the same time. 

    * Noticing a door sharply close from being fully open is a strong sign of a Yurei. This ability does not apply during events and hunts, and will not work if the ghost's current room has no door.

    * Ability is buggy, and typically only works correctly if door is half open and then is closed/opened all the way. 

    * Keep in mind that any ghost can close a door this way; the Yurei simply does it much more often because it is also part of its ability.

    * If this occurs on the exit door (without an event or a hunt), then it is definitely a Yurei.

### Possible Identifiers

* Using a smudge stick near the Yurei will prevent the ghost from wandering out of its ghost room for 90 seconds. 

    * Players can try placing a Motion Sensor at the doorway, and proceed to smudge the ghost. If the motion sensor is never set off by the ghost within the next 90 seconds, then the ghost could be a Yurei.

    * Very hard to test conclusively because its easy to mistake normal activity for this Yurei ability.

# Yurei	

🔮 Ghost Orb | 🌡️ Freezing | 👻 D.O.T.S

## Abilities

* The Yurei can close a door sharply, dropping the sanity of all players within 7.5 meters by 15%. 

## Hunt Behavior

* Using a smudge stick near the Yurei will prevent the ghost from wandering out of its ghost room for 90 seconds. 

## Identification Strategies

* Noticing a door sharply close from being fully open is a strong sign of a Yurei. This ability does not apply during events and hunts, and will not work if the ghost's current room has no door. If this occurs on the exit door (without an event or a hunt), then it is definitely a Yurei.

- Players can try placing a Motion Sensor at the doorway, and proceed to smudge the ghost. If the motion sensor is never set off by the ghost within the next 90 seconds, then the ghost could be a Yurei.

- Very hard to test for a Yurei conclusively because its easy to mistake normal activity for the Yurei's abilities. 

## False Positives

* Keep in mind that any ghost can close a door the way a Yurei does. The Yurei simply does it much more often because it is also part of its ability and it will accompany a sanity drain.

# Phantom

ðŸ”Š Spirit Box | âœ‹ Fingerprints | ðŸ‘» D.O.T.S

Abilities:

-   If a successful photo is taken of a Phantom, the ghost will be invisible in the photo and the photo will not contain any interference.
-   The Phantom has an ability where it will choose a random player and travel to their location, creating an EMF Level 2 reading where it started its walk.
-   Being within 10 meters of a Phantom while in pseudo line-of-sight during ghost events and hunts will reduce the player's sanity by 0.5%/s.

Activity:

-   If a photo is taken during a ghost event, the ghost will physically disappear, electronic equipment will stop malfunctioning, players will no longer hear their heartbeats, and the event sound will continue to play.
-   If the photo is taken during a hunt, the Phantom will be invisible in the photo, but it will continue to physically flash in and out, and the hunt will not be affected in any way.
-   During a hunt, the Phantom will flash visible every 1 to 2 seconds, making it harder to take a photo of.

Hunt Behavior:

-   The Phantom will flash visible every 1 to 2 seconds during a hunt.
-   The Phantom will randomly choose a player and travel to their location, creating an EMF Level 2 reading where it started its walk.

Identification Strategies:

-   A good way to identify a Phantom is to observe whether the ghost is invisible for longer intervals on average during hunts (more than 1 second).
-   Taking a photo of a Phantom during a ghost event is also a fair indicator. The main identifier is the ghost disappearing from view, but its vocalizations can still be heard. Additionally, the photo will be labeled as Ghost, but the Phantom will not be visible in the photo, and there will be no interference pattern on the photo.
-   If players notice activity in a room far away from its existing favorite room, and a player has recently been in that far-away room, then the ghosts could be narrowed down to a few ghosts, one of these being the Phantom.
-   Taking photos of any ghost from a different floor will not produce interference, though for all other ghosts the ghost will still be visible.

False Positives:

-   Desync may cause the same effect as taking a photo of a Phantom during a ghost event, even if the ghost is not a Phantom.
-   The Ouija Board has no relation to the Phantom's ability to wander.

### Unique Identifiers

* Taking a photo of a Phantom will make it temporarily disappear for that specific instance that it appears. 

    * This will not stop a manifestation nor a hunt if one is already in progress. In a ghost event, if the ghost disappeared as the picture was taken but his footsteps and vocalizations can still be heard, it means that it is a Phantom.

    * **Test:** The ghost's physical image will not be visible in the picture found in the journal, but will be labelled as a "Ghost" picture. Additionally, the image will appear without any electronic interference. However, any ghost can have the same effect if the photo is taken right at the end of a ghost event; be sure that the ghost event is still ongoing even when the ghost has disappeared.

* During a hunt, a Phantom will flash visible every 1 to 2 seconds as opposed to every 0.3 to 1 seconds for other ghosts. 

    * **Test:** Watch for the ghost's flickering rate; if it is invisible for longer periods of time, it is a Phantom.

### Ghost Hunt Conditions
* **Required Sanity:** Standard

* **Speed:** Standard

### Possible Identifiers
* The Phantom has an ability similar to the Wraith's, which it can use (not during a manifestation) to walk to a random player's location regardless of distance. After this, the Phantom will continue normal activity. This is more useful on large maps; if the ghost interacts or hunts near a player who is very far from the ghost room, it could be a Phantom.

* Despite what the journal states, the Phantom does not drain sanity perceptibly quicker than other ghosts.

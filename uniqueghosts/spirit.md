# Spirit

Abilities:

-   Spirits have no special abilities or unique behaviors compared to other ghosts.

Hunt Behavior:

-   When a Smudge Stick is used near a Spirit, it will not be able to initiate a hunt for 180 seconds instead of the usual 90 seconds for most other ghosts.

-   The delay caused by Smudge Sticks does not prevent cursed hunts.

Identification Strategies:

-   The main way to test for a Spirit without using evidence is to lower the average sanity to below 50% and smudge the ghost while it is not hunting. If the ghost does not initiate a hunt before three minutes have passed, it is likely a Spirit.

-   If the Spirit hunts before three minutes have passed, the Smudge Stick did not work, and the player should attempt to smudge it again.

-   In Nightmare difficulty, players should wait for a hunt or a burnt crucifix to confirm that the average sanity is low enough.

False Positives:

-   Spirits have no unique defining traits that can easily differentiate them from other ghosts.
-   Without clear evidence, a Spirit can be easily mistaken for another type of ghost.
-   Although the journal describes Spirits as the most common ghost, all ghost types have an equal chance of being selected by the game.

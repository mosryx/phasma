# Banshee

ðŸ”® Ghost Orb | âœ‹ Fingerprints | ðŸ‘» D.O.T.S

## Abilities

* At the start of the game, the Banshee will randomly select a single player as the hunt target. 

* When the ghost performs a roam, if the target is inside the investigation area, it has a 2/3 (67%) chance of roaming to the target. This differs from the Phantom's ability in that it occurs more frequently and is tied to roaming. This does not occur during hunts.

* The Banshee checks for their target's sanity when trying to initiate a hunt, instead of the team's average sanity. Like most other ghosts, its hunt sanity threshold is 50%. This means that the Banshee can appear to hunt from as early as 87.5% average sanity, or as low as 12.5% average sanity, depending on the target's sanity and number of other players. If the hunt target is outside the investigation area, the Banshee will still use the target's sanity to decide whether to hunt. 

## Activity

* When a Parabolic Microphone is used, the Banshee has a 33% chance of making a unique shriek-like [paranormal sound](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/phasmophobia/images/c/cc/NEW-Banshee-Scream.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20220214161628) instead of a whisper or footstep.

* More likely to perform singing ghost events.

    * If the banshee performs a singing event targeted at the Banshee's target and the target causes the banshee to disappear prematurely by going near it, then the banshee will decrease the target's sanity by 15% instead of the usual 10%. 

    * Like other ghosts, who the Banshee targets for a ghost event is random and based on distance. Being the hunt target by itself does not increase their chance of being the ghost event target.

## Hunt Behaviour

* When a Banshee hunts it will ignore all players other than its hunt target, so long as the hunt target is in the investigation area. It will not attempt to chase other players nor will it kill them, even if it comes into direct contact with a non-target player, instead passing through them. The Banshee will react to Smudge Sticks lit by other players, but this will not allow for completion of the "Repel a ghost while it is chasing someone" optional objective unless the Banshee is also chasing its target when this occurs.

* If the Banshee's hunt target is outside the investigation areas during a hunt, it will hunt like any other ghost, chasing any opportune player. 

## Identification Strategies

* During a hunt, have all players hidden inside the building, then let one player attempt to bait the ghost through line-of-sight (LoS) (e.g., by looping); if the ghost ignores the player, then it is a Banshee. If the player is chased, repeat with another player.

* If the ghost hunts above the average sanity of 50%, and one or more players are below 50% sanity, then one of them is the target. Likewise, if the ghost refrains from hunting at below 50% average sanity, but one player has high sanity, they can be presumed to be the Banshee's target.

* Having players act as "bait" with smudge sticks and/or escape routes ready can definitively identify the target. Bait players should stand in plain sight and attempt to actively attract the ghost, such as talking into the microphone or holding active electronics; if the ghost ignores them, have another player repeat the process then proceed by elimination until the target is found. Alternatively, multiple players can do this at a time, standing separate from each-other and seeing which of them the Banshee rushes for. This method, though more risky, is useful either when the sanity-based method proves inconclusive, or when playing on Nightmare difficulty where the Sanity Monitor is not available. Ensure that all players are inside the building when performing this test.

* On singleplayer, determining the Banshee by its target ability is impossible, so one must rely on other potential signs or pieces of evidence. The Parabolic Microphone might come it handy, however the Banshee only has a chance of producing its shriek, so it mustn't be ruled out simply because only whispers were recorded so far. Start looking for a ghost that does a lot of singing events first.

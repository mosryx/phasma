# Obake

ðŸ’¡ EMF 5 | ðŸ”® Ghost Orb | âœ‹ Fingerprints

## Unique Traits

-   Obake will always give âœ‹ Fingerprints. 

-   The Obake ghost has only a 75% chance of leaving fingerprints when it interacts with a valid surface.

-   When creating handprints or fingerprints, there is a 1/6 chance (~16.7%) for the Obake leave a unique handprint pattern. This can be either a six-fingered handprint (such as on a door), two fingerprints instead of one (such as on a light switch), five fingerprints instead of four (such as on a computer keyboard or prison cell door). 

-   The Obake can occasionally trigger an ability to reduce the remaining time for all existing, lingering fingerprints on the map by half, making it possible for a fingerprint to last for mere seconds.

## Hunt Behavior

-   During a hunt, the Obake has a 1/15 (6.67%) chance of shapeshifting into a different ghost model of the same gender every time it flickers. This is guaranteed to happen at least once per hunt, and dead players cannot see the shapeshift.

## Identification Strategies

-   If an Obake is suspected, checking a touched surface with a UV Flashlight or Glowstick each time it interacts with a door or the like is prudent to spotting the Obake's special fingerprints.

-   If the ghost touches a surface and leaves no fingerprints, then later leaves fingerprints on another surface, or vice versa, this usually points to the ghost being an Obake.

-   If you are on a zero-evidence run, the Obake will never produce fingerprints, and hence can only be identified by spotting its shapeshifting power during a hunt.

## False Positives

-   Because Obake has a 1/4 chance to leave no fingerprint evidence after an interact, and due to its ability to reduce the shelf life of all fingerprints on the map by half, its possible players may never find fingerprint evidence at all. If players have trouble finding a final piece of evidence, then Obake may be reason.

# Raiju

ðŸ’¡ EMF 5 | ðŸ”® Ghost Orb | ðŸ‘» D.O.T.S

Activity:

-   The Raiju can interfere with electronics up to 15 metres away on the same floor during a ghost event or hunt.

Hunt Behavior:

-   The Raiju moves at a fixed speed of 2.5 m/s during a hunt when within a certain distance of at least one piece of active electronic equipment. The distance the Raiju needs to be from electronics to recieve this bonus varies based on the size of the map: 6m for small, 8m for medium, and 10m for large maps.

-   When nearby at least one piece of active electronic equipment, the Raiju's hunt sanity threshold is increased to 65%.

-   Head mounted cameras, even when worn, do not count towards the speed boost or the hunt sanity threshold. Video cameras and photo cameras that are thrown on the ground, motion sensors, sound sensors, and D.O.T.S. projectors that are thrown on the ground or held, and objects in the inventory (except flashlights and strong flashlights that are turned on) also do not count. Building lights, the fuse box, CCTV cameras, fans, and any other electrical equipment not brought in from the van also do not count.

-   The Raiju follows standard ghost speeds if it is not in proximity to any electronics. However it will also gain the speed bonus from an extended chase, adding to its base speed whether or not it is near electronics. This bonus will stack with its 2.5 m/s base speed when near electronics. 

Identification Strategies:

-   To mitigate the risk of an early hunt, players should turn off and/or remove any unneeded electronic equipment from the ghost room.

-   Discarding electronic items behind them during a hunt should be avoided with Raijus to prevent leaving a trail of electronics to power its speed ability.

-   Players should switch to a non-electronic item or an electronic item that can be turned off instead of discarding them.

-   Can be identified by its speed during a hunt, particularly on small maps, when active electronic items are nearby. If the ghost continues to walk very quickly when roaming (and not chasing particular players), then it is most likely a Raiju.

### Unique Identifiers
* If the Raiju is within 6-10 metres (depending on map size) of any active electronic equipment, its speed will be fixed to 2.5 m/s. Having a ghost that is moving quickly in the presence of electronics and even while not chasing someone may indicate that the ghost is a Raiju.


* During ghost events and hunts, the Raiju will interfere with electronics up to 15 metres away, compared to 10 metres for every other ghost. This distance only applies to electronics that are on the same floor as the ghost.


* On difficulties with 2 evidence (e.g. Nightmare), obtaining EMF Level 5 and Ghost Orbs confirms the ghost to be a Raiju, since the only other ghost that has these two evidences is the Obake, which has Fingerprints as a guaranteed evidence.

### Possible Identifiers
* *Sanity:* Raijus can hunt from an average sanity of 65% if there are active electronics near it.

# Hantu

🔮 Ghost Orb | 🌡️ Freezing | ✋ Fingerprints

## Activity

* Hantu will always give 🌡️Freezing

* The Hantu is twice as likely to turn off the fuse box relative to other ghosts. The Hantu will never turn on the fuse box.

## Hunt Behaviour

* Hantu moves faster in colder temperatures during a hunt. Temperatures will typically be lower when the breaker is off than when its on, in outdoor maps when its snowing, and the ghost room will typically be colder than the rest of the house when the breaker is on.

| Room temperature | Ghost speed (m/s) | 
|------------------|------------------| 
| > 15°C (59°F) | 1.4 | 
| 12°C to 15°C (53.6°F to 59°F) | 1.75 | 
| 9°C to 12°C (48.2°F to 53.6°F) | 2.1 | 
| 6°C to 9°C (42.8°F to 48.2°F) | 2.3 | 
| 3°C to 6°C (37.4°F to 42.8°F) | 2.4 | 
| 0°C to 3°C (32°F to 37.4°F) | 2.5 | 
| < 0°C (32°F) | 2.7 |

* The Hantu does not have line-of-sight acceleration during hunts.

* When the Hantu's ghost model is visible during a hunt, it will emit freezing breath near its head in any room as long as the breaker is off. However, this ability can be very difficult to detect and other effects can be mistaken for it so should not be relied on. Dead players cannot see this breath.

## Identification Strategies

* If a Hantu is suspected, leaving the breaker on will generally be a safer strategy and help with identification. Depending on the map and weather conditions this may not always be possible however. Particularly during Light Snow weather, especially on the outdoors maps of Maple Lodge Campsite and Camp Woodwind, as ambient room temperatures will generally be lower if the fuse box is off, boosting their speed during a hunt.

* Leave the breaker turned on for a while, then listen for its speed during a hunt. Hantus will be faster in colder rooms (usually, but not always the favourite room), and slower than a normal ghost in a warm room. If the ghost appears to be fast at the start of a hunt and slows down as it gets closer to the player, this may be evidence of a Hantu.

* If ghost maintains a constant speed similar to the player while looping around a piece of furniture in a warm room, then it could be a Hantu. 

    * Ensure that the fuse box has been on for a while before performing this test, however, as Hantu will still recieve a speed bonus for ambient cold tempuratures.

    * The Hantu's presence in that room will cool the room down over time, making it increasingly harder to loop. Carry smudge sticks and plan an exit strategy before performing the test. 

## False Positives

The Hantu is one of two ghosts (the other being the Onryo) for which you can collect all three pieces of evidence without excluding The Mimic. Therefore, before concluding you're dealing with a Hantu, check whether the Spirit Box gives audio. If it does, you have The Mimic.

A Raiju will be fast near active electronics and a normal speed outside a specified range, which may cause it appear to behave like a Hantu when hunting. If this is a no-evidence game, try removing all electronics first. If at least one piece of evidence is provided, then having Freezing Temperatures as a piece of evidence will eliminate Raiju.

The Moroi can also speed up over several hunts, but as a result of gradually lowering average sanity instead. Ensure that all players maintain their sanities at a constant level.

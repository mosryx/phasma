# Spirit

üí° EMF 5 | üîä Spirit Box | üñäÔ∏è Writing

Abilities:

-   Spirits have no special abilities or unique behaviors compared to other ghosts.

Hunt Behavior:

-   When a Smudge Stick is used near a Spirit, it will not be able to initiate a hunt for 180 seconds instead of the usual 90 seconds for most other ghosts.

-   The delay caused by Smudge Sticks does not prevent cursed hunts.

Identification Strategies:

-   The main way to test for a Spirit without using evidence is to lower the average sanity to below 50% and smudge the ghost while it is not hunting. If the ghost does not initiate a hunt before three minutes have passed, it is likely a Spirit.

-   If the Spirit hunts before three minutes have passed, the Smudge Stick did not work, and the player should attempt to smudge it again.

-   In Nightmare difficulty, players should wait for a hunt or a burnt crucifix to confirm that the average sanity is low enough.

False Positives:

-   Spirits have no unique defining traits that can easily differentiate them from other ghosts.
-   Without clear evidence, a Spirit can be easily mistaken for another type of ghost.
-   Although the journal describes Spirits as the most common ghost, all ghost types have an equal chance of being selected by the game.

### Unique Identifiers
* When smudged, spirits will not hunt for 180 seconds, as opposed to the standard 90 seconds. 

    * **Test:** When testing for a Spirit, ensure that your average sanity is below 50% by reading it off the sanity monitor, or checking that it has hunted (or attempted to hunt) at least once. Then, smudge the ghost and count for 180 seconds. If the ghost hunts within 90 to 180 seconds, then it is not a Spirit. If it only hunts after the 180 seconds are up, then it is likely a Spirit. 
    * To ensure that the smudge does not fail (causing the ghost to hunt much earlier than 90 seconds), wait for it to first use the crucifix, interact with an object, or use a motion sensor to locate it, then smudge the surrounding area.

### Ghost Hunt Conditions
* **Required Sanity:** Standard

* **Speed:** Will speed up briefly when in LoS.

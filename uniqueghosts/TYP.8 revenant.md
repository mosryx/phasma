Abilities:

-   Revenants have a noticeable speed change between roaming and chasing modes.
-   It moves about at 1 m/s while roaming, but speeds up to 3 m/s when it detects a player.
-   This speed increase is nearly twice the base speed of most other ghosts.
-   Its speed slowly decreases over 2.7 seconds (deceleration rate of 0.75 m/s¬≤) back to its initial value of 1 m/s.
-   The Revenant's speed change does not stack up and does not apply to any specific player.
-   The AI only checks for whether another waypoint has been created by the ghost and overwrites the existing one.

Hunt Behavior:

-   The Revenant is very dangerous during hunts due to its speed and power.
-   Players should hide as soon as possible and exercise extreme caution as to not give away their position.
-   Players cannot outrun a Revenant for long before it catches up to them.
-   If caught running, the last resort is to use Smudge Sticks to ward it off for a few seconds, giving you enough time to hide.
-   While hiding, listen for the ghost's footsteps; if they are relatively few and far between, it is most likely a Revenant.
-   During multiplayer, the Revenant will perform an immediate area search just like any other ghost during hunts, but it will take longer due to its slow movement speed while roaming, making it easier to identify.

Identification Strategies:

-   Listen for the ghost's footsteps while hiding, as they are relatively few and far between when a Revenant is nearby.
-   During multiplayer, the Revenant will take a longer time to perform an immediate area search due to its slow movement speed while roaming.

False Positives:

-   None provided.

### Unique Identifiers
* Revenant will move noticably slower if it doesn't know the players location. If it knows the players location or can see the player, its speed will significantly increase. 

    * If player breaks LoS with Revenant, it will continue moving fast until it reaches the players last known location. If it doesn't see the player when it reaches their last known location, it will start to slow down again. 

    * Revenant will be able to detect you instantly if your flashlight is on or you speak. 

    * You can outrun a Revenant while sprinting but not walking. 

* You can tell a Revenant and Jinn apart because when the hunt begins, if out of LoS, a Revenant will move very slowly while a Jinn will be normal speed. 

### Ghost Hunt Conditions
* **Required Sanity:** Standard

* **Speed:** Very fast when it knowns the players location; very slow if it doesn't.

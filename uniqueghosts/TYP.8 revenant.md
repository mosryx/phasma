# Revenant

🔮 Ghost Orb | 🌡️ Freezing | 🖊️ Writing

## Hunt Behavior

* Revenant will move at 1 m/s while roaming if it doesn't know the players location. If it knows the players location or can see the player, it will speed up to 3 m/s.

* If player breaks LoS with Revenant, it will continue moving fast until it reaches the players last known location. If it doesn't see the player when it reaches their last known location, its speed slowly decreases over 2.7 seconds (deceleration rate of 0.75 m/s²) back to its initial value of 1 m/s.

## Identification Strategies

-   Listen for the ghost's footsteps while hiding, as they are relatively few and far between when a Revenant is nearby.

-   During multiplayer, the Revenant will take a longer time to perform an immediate area search due to its slow movement speed while roaming.

## False Positives

* You can tell a Revenant and Jinn apart because when the hunt begins, if out of LoS, a Revenant will move very slowly while a Jinn will be normal speed.

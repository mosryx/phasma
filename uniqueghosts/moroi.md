# Moroi

üîä Spirit Box | üå°Ô∏è Freezing | üñäÔ∏è Writing

## Abilities

* Moroi will always give üîäSpirit Box evidence. 

* The Moroi can curse a target when players hear them through the Spirit Box or Parabolic Microphone. When a player is cursed, their sanity drain doubles, and cannot be stopped by lights. The curse is paused temporarily when players are outside the investigation area, and Sanity Pills remove the curse for a player. Multiple players can be cursed at the same time, but they do not stack on a single player.

## Hunt Behaviour

* The Moroi's speed is dependent on the average sanity. It will speed up from 1.5 m/s % at 50% sanity to 2.25 m/s at 5% or below. The speed changes during a hunt according to the current average sanity. 

* Unlike most other ghosts with implicit speed bonuses, the Moroi accelerates with continuous line-of-sight of a player. Below 5% average sanity, the maximum speed of a Moroi is 3.71 m/s, faster than the Revenant's 3 m/s.

* Moroi cannot see nor kill players for 12 seconds when smudged during a hunt, twice as long as the usual 6 seconds.

## Identification Strategies

* After a player receives a spirit box response, keep track of the sanity of all players; if one person's sanity drops noticeably quicker than others, then it is likely a Moroi.

* The Moroi becomes faster as the average sanity becomes lower. If the ghost speeds up over several hunts, then it could be a Moroi. Note that the Hantu can speed up if the fuse box is off over several hunts, so ensure that the fuse box remains turned on.

* On Nightmare difficulty, after receiving a spirit box response, the questioner should immediately return to the van and consume sanity pills to reach maximum sanity, hold a lit candle going back in, then receive another response from the spirit box, wait about 30 seconds, then finally return to the van again and attempt to eat another sanity pill. If the player can eat a sanity pill (barring any ghost events or other abilities), then it is probably a Moroi. Some ghosts such as the Yurei or Jinn can drop the sanity of nearby players; try to eliminate this as a possibility.

* If you notice the ghost moving fast while hunting, and you use pills while it's hunting and notice the ghost's speed suddenly drop, this could be evidence for a Moroi. 

## False Positives

* Because Moroi's speed increases as the player's sanity goes down, it can sometimes be mistaken for other fast moving ghosts such as a Thaye or Revenant.

* Because Moroi can damage the player's sanity very fast if it uses its curse ability, it can easily be mistaken for an early hunter despite only being able to hunt at 50%.

üîä Spirit Box ‚úã Fingerprints | üñäÔ∏è Writing

Abilities:

-   The Poltergeist has the unique ability to throw items every 0.5 seconds during a hunt, which is more frequent than other ghosts.
-   The force value of items thrown by the Poltergeist can range from 2 to 6, which is higher than other ghosts.
-   The Poltergeist can use an ability to throw multiple nearby items at once, generating an EMF level 2 reading and decreasing the sanity of nearby players.

Activity:

-   The Poltergeist is more likely to throw items in general.
-   Turning off the lights can increase the Poltergeist's activity.

Hunt Behaviour:

-   During a hunt, the Poltergeist will always throw an item every 0.5 seconds.
-   The Poltergeist may use its ability to throw multiple nearby items at once during a hunt.

Identification Strategies:

-   Scatter multiple objects around in the Poltergeist's room and observe if one object is thrown with force across the room or if multiple objects are thrown at once.
-   If a player experiences a decrease in sanity while in line-of-sight with an EMF level 2 location, it is likely a Poltergeist.

False Positives:

-   The Poltergeist's ability to throw items can overlap with other ghosts, making it harder to discern its unique trait in smaller rooms.
-   Other ghosts, such as the Oni and Thaye, can also exhibit high levels of activity by frequently throwing items, making it important to consider other evidence before guessing it is a Poltergeist.

## Poltergeist	

### Unique Identifiers
* Poltergeists can throw multiple objects at once, which will decrease nearby players' sanity; the decrease is by 2% times the number of objects moved.

    * **Test:** Make a pile of multiple items. If the ghost moves/throws mutiple items at once, it's a Poltergeist. 

* During hunts, the Poltergeist has a 100% chance to throw an item in its path every 0.5 seconds, unlike other ghosts which only have a 50% chance of doing so. Noticing almost every prop the ghost passes being thrown with considerable strength is a strong sign of a Poltergeist.

### Possible Identifiers
* Poltergeists tend to throw objects more frequently than other ghosts.

* Poltergeists can throw objects with much more strength than other ghosts. Noticing items being "shot" across the room or items that seem to have been launched from far away (i.e, a dining utensil found across the living room from the nearby dining room) is a possible sign of a Poltergeist.

Poltergeists are more likely to throw objects, and have a 100% chance of interacting with objects during hunts, instead of 50%

    When throwing an object, it has a chance of throwing it with 2 - 6 power instead of 1 - 3 power
    Poltergeists also have an ability to throw all nearby items with this power

### Ghost Hunt Conditions
* **Required Sanity:** Standard

* **Speed:** Standard

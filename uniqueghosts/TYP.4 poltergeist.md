# Poltergeist

üîä Spirit Box ‚úã Fingerprints | üñäÔ∏è Writing

## Abilities

-   The Poltergeist can use an ability to throw multiple nearby items at once, generating an EMF level 2 reading and decreasing the sanity of nearby players. The force value of items thrown by the Poltergeist can range from 2 to 6, which is higher than other ghosts.

## Activity

* Poltergeists tend to throw objects more frequently than other ghosts. 

- When throwing an object, it has a chance of throwing it with 2 - 6 power instead of 1 - 3 power

- Turning off the lights can increase the Poltergeist's activity.

## Hunt Behavior

* During hunts, the Poltergeist has a 100% chance to throw an item in its path every 0.5 seconds, unlike other ghosts which only have a 50% chance of doing so. Noticing almost every prop the ghost passes being thrown with considerable strength is a strong sign of a Poltergeist.

## Identification Strategies

-   Scatter multiple objects around in the Poltergeist's room and observe if one object is thrown with force across the room or if multiple objects are thrown at once.

-   If a player experiences a decrease in sanity while in line-of-sight with an EMF level 2 location, it is likely a Poltergeist.

* Poltergeists can throw objects with much more strength than other ghosts. Noticing items being "shot" across the room or items that seem to have been launched from far away (i.e, a dining utensil found across the living room from the nearby dining room) is a possible sign of a Poltergeist.

## False Positives

-   The Poltergeist's ability to throw items can overlap with other ghosts, making it harder to discern its unique trait in smaller rooms.

-   Other ghosts, such as the Oni and Thaye, can also exhibit high levels of activity by frequently throwing items, making it important to consider other evidence before guessing it is a Poltergeist.

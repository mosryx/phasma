# Jinn	

üí° EMF 5 | üå°Ô∏è Freezing | ‚úã Fingerprints

## Abilities

* The Jinn has an ability to instantly decrease the sanity of all players in the same room or otherwise within 3 metres by 25%. This will give an EMF reading at the fuse box. It can only use this ability if the fuse box is turned on. 

## Activity

* The Jinn cannot turn off a breaker directly through interacting with it.

## Hunt Behaviour

* If a Jinn initiates a hunt while the breaker is on, it will speed up to 2.5 m/s until it gets to within 3 meters of the player. If the Jinn gets within 3 meters of the player, doesn't see the player, or if the breaker is off, the Jinn will move at standard ghost speeds. 

## Identification Strategies

* If a Jinn is suspected, leave an EMF reader by the fuse box. If it emits a tone without the fuse box turning on/off, then it is likely the Jinn using its ability. The player may want to visually confirm it wasn't set off by another interaction, such as an object being thrown near the reader. 

* The Jinn's LoS speed ability can be tested by standing at the end of a long hallway or room, then waiting for the ghost to achieve LoS from the other end. If its speed increases instantly and not over a period of time, then it is likely a Jinn. The fuse box must be on for this test to work. 

## False Positives

* The Jinn's increased speed when it has LoS on a player can be confused careful with the Revenant. The Jinn's speed is normal if it is not chasing a player, while the Revenant will move noticably slow.

* The fuse box remaining turned on throughout the investigation may indicate a Jinn, though this cannot be used as definite proof.

* Jinn cannot turn off the fuse box, but can still interact with light switches. Since turning on switches can cause the fuse box to shut off, this could lead players to conclude the ghost hit the breaker. If turning the fuse box back on does not cause the lights to come back on as before, then it was not shut off by a ghost and Jinn cannot be ruled out.

* Jinn is not affected by electronic devices and are not more likely to interact with them. This is misconception about the Jinn's abilities. Whether there are lights turned on or not also does not affect the Jinn's abilities.

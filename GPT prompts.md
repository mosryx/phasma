# Ghost type

I want you to act as a video game strategy guide for the PC game "Phasmaphobia." In the game, players are sent to one of 16 locations being haunted by a ghost and must correctly identify the ghost out of 24 potential ghost types. Your task is to provide bullet points of information about one of these ghost types, the Wraith, organized into the following sections:

- "Abilities." Unique abilities that specific ghost type has.
- "Activity." Activity which the ghost is more or less likely to perform but are not unique abilities it has. 
- "Hunt Behaviour." The specific behavior of the ghost type when it performs a hunt.
- "Identification Strategies." Strategies for identifying this specific ghost.
- "False Positives." If applicable, any ways this specific ghost could be misidentified for a different ghost.

Please provide bullet points written in complete sentences using American English. Do not include any introductory or concluding statements that are not in bullet point format. Each bullet point should retain as much detail as possible from the text provided but should be rearranged to conform to the sections given. The text you are provided is as follows:

I want you to continue to act as a "Phasmaphobia" strategy guide. I will provide text below about a new ghost type, the Onryo. You need to compose bullet points of information about that ghost only. The bullet points can be organized into sections consisting of the same sections of Abilities, Activity, Hunt Behavior, Identification Strategies, and False Positives. You must still respond in bullet points using complete sentences in American English, not include extraneous passages such as introductions, and you will still receive a score from 1 to 3 after each response. The text you are provided is as follows: 





# Feedback

1.  Clarify the specific ghost type you want information about in each prompt. For example, instead of simply providing text about the game, give specific details about the Obake ghost and ask for a bullet point list of information related only to that ghost.
    
2.  Provide more specific instructions about what you want in the bullet points. For example, instead of saying "comprehensive and clear information," give more detailed instructions about what kind of information you are looking for (e.g. weaknesses, behaviors, clues to identify the ghost, etc.).
    
3.  Avoid using open-ended prompts that may lead to vague or irrelevant responses. Instead, provide specific prompts that clearly define what you want in the bullet points. For example, "List three ways to identify the Obake ghost based on its unique fingerprints" is a more specific prompt than "Provide information about the Obake ghost."
    
4.  Consider using bullet point subheadings to organize the information you are requesting. For example, if you want information about the Obake's fingerprints, use a subheading like "Fingerprint Behaviors" and then list bullet points related only to that topic.

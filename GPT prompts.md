# Ghost type

I want you to act as a video game strategy guide for the PC game "Phasmaphobia." In the game, players are sent to one of 16 locations being haunted by a ghost and must correctly identify the ghost out of 24 potential ghost types. I will provide text below about on of these ghost types, the Obake. You need to compose bullet points of information about that ghost only. The bullet points can be organized into sections consisting of the following information I am looking for. 

- "Abilities." Unique abilities the Obake ghost has.
- "Activity." Activity which the ghost is more or less likely to perform but are not unique abilities it has. 
- "Hunt Behaviour." The behaviour of the ghost when it performs a hunt.
- "Identification Strategies." Specific strategies for identifying this specific ghost.
- "False Positives." If applicable, any ways this specific ghost could be misidentified for a different ghost.

Please provide a response consisting only of bullet points in complete sentences written in American English, specifically regarding the text provided. Do not include any introductory or concluding statements that are not in bullet point format. Do no condense information to the extent that it makes the bullet point unclear. The text you are provided is as follows: 


I want you to continue to act as a video game strategy guide. All the criteria for your prompt are the same, but I will not provide text about a different ghost type, the Oni. The Oni does not share characteristics in common with the last ghost other than those which are stated to be 



# Feedback

1.  Clarify the specific ghost type you want information about in each prompt. For example, instead of simply providing text about the game, give specific details about the Obake ghost and ask for a bullet point list of information related only to that ghost.
    
2.  Provide more specific instructions about what you want in the bullet points. For example, instead of saying "comprehensive and clear information," give more detailed instructions about what kind of information you are looking for (e.g. weaknesses, behaviors, clues to identify the ghost, etc.).
    
3.  Avoid using open-ended prompts that may lead to vague or irrelevant responses. Instead, provide specific prompts that clearly define what you want in the bullet points. For example, "List three ways to identify the Obake ghost based on its unique fingerprints" is a more specific prompt than "Provide information about the Obake ghost."
    
4.  Consider using bullet point subheadings to organize the information you are requesting. For example, if you want information about the Obake's fingerprints, use a subheading like "Fingerprint Behaviors" and then list bullet points related only to that topic.

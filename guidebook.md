# Perfect Game

## Photo evidence
In the game there are a number of items that count as photo evidence. Photo evidence can be counted by taking a photo of certain items with the photo camera.

Items that count towards photo evidence:

* Bones (also can be picked up and will not use up an item slot)
* Dead Bodies or when the ghost is killing a teammate
* Fingerprints
* Footprints
* Ghost as a physical manifestation
* Ghost Writing Book containing writing
* Items that have recently been moved by the ghost (i.e. bottles, ghost book, doors, etc.)
* Cursed possessions
* Sink containing dirty water
* Burned crucifixes
* D.O.T.S Projector silhouette
* Salt pile

## Hunt Behavior



Most of its general behaviour (such as movement speed, hunting patterns, activity etc.) is based on the type of ghost, except for its willingness to respond to the spirit box in the presence of multiple people in the room, which is randomly set. 

For all ghosts, if the target for most ghost events (not to be confused with a Banshee target) collides with the ghost or smoke ball, causing it to disappear, that player loses 10% of their sanity. 

During hunts, the ghost will materialise itself and proceed to roam around the location in order to kill one or more players. For the duration of the hunt, lights in the ghost's current room will flicker, all exit doors will become locked, and the ghost will cause all nearby electronic equipment to malfunction. 

Once a hunt ends, there is a minimum cooldown of 25 seconds before the ghost can attempt to initiate another hunt. This does not affect cursed hunts. Ghosts do not necessarily hunt immediately once this cooldown is over. 

For most ghosts, the average team sanity is used to determine whether the ghost can hunt. The average sanity is of all players who are alive, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the investigation area. Dead players do not count towards the average team sanity.

For most ghosts, the hunt sanity threshold is 50%; ghosts can initiate hunts at random once the average sanity is at or below 50%. Every few seconds, the game has a chance to check for the required sanity value, then rolls a probability to decide whether to hunt. The probability increases at lower sanities; hunts occur more often at lower average sanities. 

At the point that the ghost attempts to initiate a hunt, if a crucifix is within 3 metres of the ghost (5 metres for a Demon), the hunt will fail. Each time a crucifix is used, the ghost must wait 25 seconds (20 seconds for a Demon) before attempting to initiate a hunt again. Each crucifix can prevent a hunt 2 times before becoming useless.

Lighting smudge sticks near the ghost will prevent it from attempting to initiate further hunts for 60 seconds for a Demon, 180 seconds for a Spirit, and 90 seconds for all other ghosts.

The ghost cannot detect or see players during this grace period.

Hunts always initiate from wherever the ghost is standing (except for The Twins in specific cases); it does not have to start from any specific room. Once the grace period begins, an EMF 4 signal will be emitted at the point where the ghost is standing. 

Once the grace period ends, the ghost will proceed to either wander in a random direction, or chase a player. Ghosts cannot teleport during hunts. 

The ghost's vision is 360 degrees.
There is no maximum distance at which the ghost can see the player.
Most physical objects or structures, excluding throwables or certain types of furniture that are thin or small, will block LoS. For example, this includes glass windows and doors, and cell walls and doors in Prison.

During a hunt, ghosts can hear players up to 9 metres away and on the same floor.

Whether the ghost can hear the player is dictated by their voice chat settings. When voice chat is activated, any sound above a certain volume, whether from the player talking or background noise, will attract the ghost within the specified distance.

Using global chat within 9 metres of the ghost, even without talking, will attract it to the player using it. This does not attract the ghost to other players; players outside the investigation area using global chat will not cause players inside to die.
		
		
For comparison, the normal electronic interference range is 10 metres.

Voice communication and electronic detection are similar in terms of detection priority. If the ghost is considered to be on a different floor from the player, the ghost can only detect the player through LoS. Otherwise, the ghost will not be able to detect the player through other methods.

The following do not attract the ghost:

    Footsteps;
    Door, closet and locker noises;
    Electronics on the floor, even when turned on;
    Electronics that are held and turned off;
    Crucifixes;
    Lit smudge sticks;
    Candles and glowsticks, even when lit;
    Players outside the investigation area (except Deogen in some cases).
		
If the ghost is within 6 metres of any player while a smudge stick is burning, regardless of who is holding the smudge stick, and is successfully "pinged", the ghost will be unable to detect or kill players for 6 seconds, and be put into a "wandering" phase. When the effect ends, it will be able to detect and kill players again, resuming its normal hunting behaviour. The smudge stick technically does not "repel" the ghost away from the player, only that it will randomly set a new waypoint which may or may not be in the same direction as the player. 


Most ghosts move at a base speed of 1.7 m/s.[3] If the ghost has active line-of-sight (LoS) with a player it is chasing, its speed will gradually increase over time, capped at 1.65 times its base speed. With continuous LoS, ghosts will take approximately 10-15 seconds to reach this maximum speed from base speed.[verification needed] If it loses detection of a player, its speed will slowly decrease back to base speed (at a rate much slower than its acceleration) once it has given up the "immediate area search". Ghosts do not carry over their speed across hunts. 


Ghosts have a chance of changing favourite room when performing long roams, and each singular roam has a maximum path distance of 10 metres.

    A ghost can realistically change from the Dining Room in Tanglewood to the Master Bedroom in one roam.
    A ghost in the Foyer of Bleasdale Farmhouse would have to minimally change favourite rooms to the Upstairs Hallway first, before possibly changing to the Attic.
    A ghost in the A/B blocks of Prison would find it very hard to change rooms to the front section of the map, since the intermediate hallway cannot be chosen as a favourite room.

However, ghosts such as the Wraith, Phantom, and Banshee can go to a player anywhere on the map, and hence have a higher chance of changing favourite rooms. Otherwise, in general, the further a room is from the ghost('s current favourite room), the lower the chance is of the ghost changing its favourite room to there. 



In general, most ghosts (including Wraiths) cannot see players through doors or walls. However, during hunts, all ghosts can pass through doors as if they didn't exist. 

The ghost's vision is unaffected by darkness, and they can see players in the dark just as well as they can in the light. Conversely, ghosts do not actually "see" the light beam from a flashlight, instead sensing it as with other active electronic equipment, nor can they see the light emitted by any other type of equipment, electronic or non-electronic. 




Unlike ghost events and hunts, interactions are not directly affected by sanity.[1] Instead, having the lights turned on in rooms where the ghost is present will make it less likely to interact, which incidentally may reduce the player's sanity drain as they stay in the light more, hence giving the impression that lower sanity increases activity. 

Ghosts can interact with a variety of items, including handheld objects, doors, windows and switches. Each interaction causes an EMF 2 or 3 reading emitted at the point of interaction for 20 seconds, depending on the type of interaction. If the ghost has EMF Level 5 as one of its evidences, each individual reading has a 25% chance to be EMF 5 instead. Subsequently, when touching surfaces or switches, the relevant ghosts may also leave fingerprints on them.

Most ghosts can interact with objects that are up to 3 metres away. Ghosts can interact with objects through walls. Props (not fixed objects such as doors) are thrown with a "power" of 1 - 3.

During hunts, ghosts have a 50% chance of throwing a nearby prop every 0.5 seconds. Ghosts can also interact with doors during hunts, though at a different rate.

The chance of an interaction can be increased through the following:

    Playing on a lower difficulty
    Customizing the ghost's interaction rate on the Custom Difficulty settings
    Cleansing the area near the ghost with smudge sticks
    Saying phrases that are recognised by the game, such as its name or questions
        This has a cooldown of 10 seconds, the player must be near the ghost, and only increases the chance of interactions in general
    Forcing an interaction through cursed objects



Every time a map is loaded in, an area will be randomly selected to be the favourite room. The favourite room is relevant for the following behaviour:

    The ghost will spawn in the favourite room at the start of the contract.
    The ghost will teleport to the favourite room at the end of every hunt.
    The ghost will roam back to the room after certain conditions are satisfied.
    Ghost Orbs, if the ghost has the evidence, will be present in only the favourite room.
    The Haunted Mirror will show a view of the favourite room.
    The Hermit tarot card will teleport the ghost to the favourite room and temporarily trap it there.
		
		
Three criteria are used to determine whether the favourite room will change. If the ghost performs a 'long roam' and ends up in a room that is not its current favourite room, the ghost will perform a chance roll based on the Changing favourite room difficulty setting:

    None (Amateur, Intermediate): 0%
    Low (Professional): 33%
    Medium (Nightmare): 66%
    High (Insanity): 100%

If the chance above succeeds, a second chance roll is performed on the complement of the average sanity (or insanity); for example, an average sanity of 80% has a 20% chance of succeeding. If both chances are successful, the favourite room will change to the ghost's current room. 


In most cases, ghosts can interact with items that are up to 3 metres away of its current position. The exceptions (relevant for this section) are:

    All ghosts can interact with the fuse box remotely (i.e. turn off or on).
        However, ghosts must be within 3 metres of the fuse box to interact with its door (if applicable).
				
Visual and audio clues

One way to identify interactions is to silently walk around and look carefully for sounds produced by the ghost or objects being out of place. For example:
Visual and audio

    Doors being unexpectedly opened or closed, or seen being moved without anyone nearby. The sound produced by a ghost when touching a door is distinct from the sound that players cause
    A faucet (i.e. Dirty Water) or shower running
    An item being thrown or hitting the floor/being out of place, like food utensils or paintings being on the floor
    Car alarms, televisions, or computers being turned on
    Light switches being turned on/off, or being unexpectedly turned on
    Fans rumbling
    A piano key being pressed
    A rocking chair rocking
    Sunny Meadows - Crosses found hung on walls being turned upside down
    Sunny Meadows - Metronomes being turned on.
    Sunny Meadows - Alarm clocks being turned on.
		
Audio only

    Phones ringing
    Radios (not player walkie-talkies) being turned on
    Teddy bears laughing/giggling
    Window knocks
    Guitars being strummed

Visual only

    Mannequins being rotated or teleported; the location where the mannequin was teleported from is where the ghost was
    Teddy bear head being turned
    Teddy bear/bunny/ball being teleported
		
		
		
All interactions generate an EMF reading that lasts 20 seconds, so once you hear or see something, use the reader to identify which item it was. 



Ghosts lower the temperature of the room that they are currently in to a certain point, regardless of whether they are inside or outside.
Temperature ranges

Note: The temperature values below take into account how the thermometer reading fluctuates and are not exact conversions

Ghosts cool down the room that they are currently occupying. When a room is at its coldest, the temperature reading range on the thermometer will be as follows:

    Ghosts with Freezing Temperatures as evidence: −12°C to −6°C (12°F to 18°F)
    Ghosts without Freezing Temperatures as evidence:
        'Sunrise' weather: 5°C to 11°C (42.6°F to 48.6°F)
        'Clear' or 'Fog' weather: 3°C to 9°C (39°F to 45°F)
        All other weather types: 0°C to 6°C (33.6°F to 39.6°F)

At the start of the game, all rooms (including the ghost's current room) start at either the maximum possible temperature (if the fuse box starts on), or at their ambient temperatures (which depends on the weather). Hence, the first thing to do when using temperatures to look for the ghost is to turn on the fuse box, if not already.

Since temperatures will rise and fall slowly, one should wait at least a minute before looking for rooms with low temperatures. In addition, it may take a few minutes after the ghost leaves a room for it to no longer be freezing. Do not assume that the ghost is still in a room just because it is freezing.

After waiting for temperatures to change, check the temperature of the room:

    Less likely candidates for the ghost's current room:
        'Sunrise' weather: > 12°C (49.6°F)
        'Clear Skies' or 'Fog' weather: > 10°C (46°F)
        All other weather types: > 7°C (40.6°F)
    More likely candidates for the ghost's current room:
        'Sunrise' weather: < 11°C (48.6°F)
        'Clear Skies' or 'Fog' weather: < 9°C (45°F)
        All other weather types: < 6°C (39.6°F)

In outdoor rooms (such as on campsites), being able to discern "normal" and "abnormal" temperatures may be more difficult.

Lighting the campfire on Maple Lodge Campsite and Camp Woodwind will warm up the surrounding area (room). Other than this, turning on the generator will not affect temperatures in outdoor areas. 



Without adjusting for volume fall-off, the maximum distance a player can hear ghost footsteps and vocalisations during a hunt is 20 metres (12 metres for Myling). If the player(s) and the ghost are located on different floors during the hunt, there will be no electronic interference and the ghost's footsteps and vocalisations will be greatly muffled, though the range is still the same. Sound occlusion and electronic interference does not account for walls and staircases: a ghost going up a staircase may sound muffled and not cause electronic interference on the upper floor until it reaches the top, for example.

Within 10 metres of the ghost (15 metres for Raiju), all active electronic equipment and map lights will malfunction and/or flicker rapidly. Players can hear their own heartbeat if the ghost is within 10 metres, and there are no walls, floors, or doors between the ghost and the player. Furniture does not prevent heartbeats even when the ghost technically does not have line-of-sight with the player.

During a hunt, the ghost will flicker or flash in and out of existence, with a visibility length between 0.08 to 0.3 seconds, and an invisibility length between 0.3 to 1 seconds. The first flicker-in occurs immediately when the grace period ends. Some ghosts have different flickering behaviours:

    The Phantom's invisibility length is between 1 to 2 seconds.
    The Deogen's invisibility length is lower than 0.3 to 1 second.
    The Oni's visibility length is longer than 0.08 to 0.3 seconds.
    The Obake has a 1 in 15 (~6.67%) chance per flicker-in of appearing as a different ghost model. This will return to its normal model on the next flicker-in, and is guaranteed to happen at least once per hunt.

Taken correctly, one can obtain rewardable ghost photos during a hunt while the ghost flashes visible.

# Unique Traits

## Banshee
🔮 Ghost Orb | ✋ Fingerprints | 👻 D.O.T.S

### Unique Identifiers

* At the start of the game, the Banshee will randomly select a single player as the hunt target. 

* When the ghost performs a roam, if the target is inside the investigation area, it has a 2/3 (67%) chance of roaming to the target. This differs from the Phantom's ability in that it occurs more frequently and is tied to roaming. This does not occur during hunts.

* The Banshee checks for their target's sanity when trying to initiate a hunt, instead of the team's average sanity. Like most other ghosts, its hunt sanity threshold is 50%. This means that the Banshee can appear to hunt from as early as 87.5% average sanity, or as low as 12.5% average sanity, depending on the target's sanity and number of other players. If the hunt target is outside the investigation area, the Banshee will still use the target's sanity to decide whether to hunt. 

### Possible Identifiers

* When a Parabolic Microphone is used, the Banshee has a 33% chance of making a unique shriek-like [paranormal sound](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/phasmophobia/images/c/cc/NEW-Banshee-Scream.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20220214161628) instead of a whisper or footstep.

* More likely to perform singing ghost events.

    * If the banshee performs a singing event targeted at the Banshee's target and the target causes the banshee to disappear prematurely by going near it, then the banshee will decrease the target's sanity by 15% instead of the usual 10%. 

    * Like other ghosts, who the Banshee targets for a ghost event is random and based on distance. Being the hunt target by itself does not increase their chance of being the ghost event target.

### Hunt Behaviour

* When a Banshee hunts it will ignore all players other than its hunt target, so long as the hunt target is in the investigation area. It will not attempt to chase other players nor will it kill them, even if it comes into direct contact with a non-target player, instead passing through them. The Banshee will react to Smudge Sticks lit by other players, but this will not allow for completion of the "Repel a ghost while it is chasing someone" optional objective unless the Banshee is also chasing its target when this occurs.

* If the Banshee's hunt target is outside the investigation areas during a hunt, it will hunt like any other ghost, chasing any opportune player. 

### Strategies

* During a hunt, have all players hidden inside the building, then let one player attempt to bait the ghost through line-of-sight (LoS) (e.g., by looping); if the ghost ignores the player, then it is a Banshee. If the player is chased, repeat with another player.

* If the ghost hunts above the average sanity of 50%, and one or more players are below 50% sanity, then one of them is the target. Likewise, if the ghost refrains from hunting at below 50% average sanity, but one player has high sanity, they can be presumed to be the Banshee's target.

* Having players act as "bait" with smudge sticks and/or escape routes ready can definitively identify the target. Bait players should stand in plain sight and attempt to actively attract the ghost, such as talking into the microphone or holding active electronics; if the ghost ignores them, have another player repeat the process then proceed by elimination until the target is found. Alternatively, multiple players can do this at a time, standing separate from each-other and seeing which of them the Banshee rushes for. This method, though more risky, is useful either when the sanity-based method proves inconclusive, or when playing on Nightmare difficulty where the Sanity Monitor is not available. Ensure that all players are inside the building when performing this test.

* On singleplayer, determining the Banshee by its target ability is impossible, so one must rely on other potential signs or pieces of evidence. The Parabolic Microphone might come it handy, however the Banshee only has a chance of producing its shriek, so it mustn't be ruled out simply because only whispers were recorded so far. Start looking for a ghost that does a lot of singing events first.

## Demon	

🌡️ Freezing | ✋ Fingerprints | 🖊️ Writing

### Unique Identifiers

* The Demon has a hunt sanity threshold of 70%, instead of the standard 50%. This does not affect and is independent from its hunt ability, although the hunt does not differ in any way.

* The Demon has an ability that allows it to start a hunt regardless of current average sanity. Crucifixes can block this hunt like any other non-cursed hunt.

* Demons have a minimum cooldown of 20 seconds between hunts, instead of the usual 25 seconds.

* Smudging a Demon will prevent hunts for only 60 seconds, as opposed to the standard 90 seconds.

* The Demon has an interaction range of 5 metres instead of 3.

* The effective range of a crucifix is 5 meters instead of the standard 3 meters.

### Strategies

* Having a lazily placed crucifix burn when the ghost would normally not have used it may indicate a Demon, though ghosts could happen to wander away from their room into the crucifix's range

* A crucifix being used while still on the van wall on 42 Edgefield Road is almost certainly a Demon (usually in the garage)

* A cooldown of less than 25 seconds (excluding hunts caused by cursed possessions) may indicate a Demon.

* A ghost hunting between 60 - 90 seconds after being smudged correctly may indicate a Demon.

    * Note that ghosts do not necessarily hunt after the cooldown is over; having hunts consistently being more than 25 seconds apart do not necessarily eliminate the Demon as a possibility.

## Deogen

🔊 Spirit Box | 🖊️ Writing | 👻 D.O.T.S

### Unique Identifiers

* Deogen will always give 🔊Spirit Box.

* The Deogen's hunt sanity threshold is 40%. 

* When the Deogen is chasing a player, Deogen will move very fast when far away from the player (3 m/s when more than 6 meters away), and then incredibly slowly when it gets close to the player (0.4 m/s when closer than 2.5 meters). 

### Possible Identifiers

* The Deogen is more likely to interact with the D.O.T.S Projector and Ghost Writing Book, and on average will write in a book earlier than other ghosts, and show up more often as a silhouette on the D.O.T.S Projector.

* When using the spirit box when the Deogen is very close by, it has a 33% chance with each question to produce a unique response of constant heavy [bull-like breathing](https://youtu.be/Zm2w4X-TU2c).

### Hunt Behaviour

* The Deogen can see all the players on the map at all times during hunt. 

* When the hunt begins, the Deogen will pick the nearest player (by straight-line distance) to move towards. It will occasionally "refresh" and repick the nearest target throughout the hunt. 
    
* Using a Smudge Stick will stun the Deogen temporarily and force it to pick the nearest target when the smudge effect runs out. Its speed will remain at its current speed when smudged.

* The Deogen flashes invisible for shorter than the standard 0.3 to 1 second range during a hunt, meaning it will be visible for longer than a usual ghost.

### Strategies

* The most straightforward form of identification is for the ghost to hunt. If it approaches the nearest player at high speeds and slows down drastically as it approaches, then it is a Deogen. 

    * Note that a "young" Thaye, a Revenant that has detected someone, and a Hantu when the power has been out for a while and room temperatures are at their lowest, may move at similar speeds, but without slowing down drastically (if at all); mistaking them for a Deogen can be deadly. 

* A non-hunt way would be to constantly track the ghost and look for the signature heavy breathing through the spirit box, though this will be more tedious.

## Goryo

💡 EMF 5 | ✋ Fingerprints | 👻 D.O.T.S

### Unique Identifiers

* Goryo will always give 👻 D.O.T.S.

* A Goryo will only interact with a D.O.T.S Projector if no players are in the same room as the ghost. 

* A Goryo D.O.T.S silhouette is only visible through a Video Camera, and cannot be seen with the naked eye. It will still manifest normally during ghost events and hunts.

* The Goryo will never change its favorite room, even when the difficulty allows for it.

* When performing a roam, the maximum distance that a Goryo can roam in one go is 5 metres, instead of the standard maximum of 10 metres. 

### Strategies

* It is necessary to have a Video Camera either placed facing an active D.O.T.S. Projector, or held by a player outside the ghost's room. If D.O.T.S. evidence is visible in the camera's screen, but invisible in direct view, the ghost is likely to be a Goryo. Conversely, if D.O.T.S. is seen without the aid of a video camera, a Goryo can be safely ruled out.

* The Goryo is less likely to wander far distances. If ghost activity seems relatively confined to its room and the immediate vicinity (excluding ghost events and hunts), then it could be a Goryo.

## Hantu

🔮 Ghost Orb | 🌡️ Freezing | ✋ Fingerprints

### Unique Identifiers

* Hantu will always give 🌡️Freezing.

* Hantu moves faster in colder temperatures. 

    * Hantu will move faster if the breaker is off than when its on, faster in outdoor maps when its snowing than inside, and faster in the ghost room than the rest of the house when the breaker is on.

* The Hantu will never turn on the fuse box. 

### Possible Identifiers

* The Hantu is twice as likely to turn off the fuse box relative to other ghosts.

### Hunt Behaviour

* The Hantu does not have line-of-sight acceleration during hunts. 

* When the Hantu's ghost model is visible during a hunt, it will emit freezing breath near its head in any room as long as the breaker is off. However, this ability can be very difficult to detect and other effects can be mistaken for it so should not be relied on. Dead players cannot see this breath.

### Identification Strategies

* If a Hantu is suspected, leaving the breaker on will generally be a safer strategy and help with identification. Depending on the map and weather conditions this may not always be possible however. Particularly during Light Snow weather, especially on the outdoors maps of Maple Lodge Campsite and Camp Woodwind, as ambient room temperatures will generally be lower if the fuse box is off, boosting their speed during a hunt.

* Leave the breaker turned on for a while, then listen for its speed during a hunt. Hantus will be faster in colder rooms (usually, but not always the favourite room), and slower than a normal ghost in a warm room. If the ghost appears to be fast at the start of a hunt and slows down as it gets closer to the player, this may be evidence of a Hantu.

* If ghost maintains a constant speed similar to the player while looping around a piece of furniture in a warm room, then it could be a Hantu. 

    * Ensure that the fuse box has been on for a while before performing this test, however, as Hantu will still recieve a speed bonus for ambient cold tempuratures.

    * The Hantu's presence in that room will cool the room down over time, making it increasingly harder to loop. Carry smudge sticks and plan an exit strategy before performing the test. 

### False Positives

The Hantu is one of two ghosts (the other being the Onryo) for which you can collect all three pieces of evidence without excluding The Mimic. Therefore, before concluding you're dealing with a Hantu, check whether the Spirit Box gives audio. If it does, you have The Mimic.

A Raiju will be fast near active electronics and a normal speed outside a specified range, which may cause it appear to behave like a Hantu when hunting. If this is a no-evidence game, try removing all electronics first. If at least one piece of evidence is provided, then having Freezing Temperatures as a piece of evidence will eliminate Raiju.

The Moroi can also speed up over several hunts, but as a result of gradually lowering average sanity instead. Ensure that all players maintain their sanities at a constant level.

## Jinn	

💡 EMF 5 | 🌡️ Freezing | ✋ Fingerprints

### Abilities

* The Jinn has an ability to instantly decrease the sanity of all players in the same room or otherwise within 3 metres by 25%. This will give an EMF reading at the fuse box. It can only use this ability if the fuse box is turned on. 

### Activity

* The Jinn cannot turn off a breaker directly through interacting with it.

### Hunt Behaviour

* If a Jinn initiates a hunt while the breaker is on, it will speed up to 2.5 m/s until it gets to within 3 meters of the player. If the Jinn gets within 3 meters of the player, doesn't see the player, or if the breaker is off, the Jinn will move at standard ghost speeds. 

### Identification Strategies

* If a Jinn is suspected, leave an EMF reader by the fuse box. If it emits a tone without the fuse box turning on/off, then it is likely the Jinn using its ability. The player may want to visually confirm it wasn't set off by another interaction, such as an object being thrown near the reader. 

* The Jinn's LoS speed ability can be tested by standing at the end of a long hallway or room, then waiting for the ghost to achieve LoS from the other end. If its speed increases instantly and not over a period of time, then it is likely a Jinn. The fuse box must be on for this test to work. 

### False Positives

* The Jinn's increased speed when it has LoS on a player can be confused careful with the Revenant. The Jinn's speed is normal if it is not chasing a player, while the Revenant will move noticably slow.

* The fuse box remaining turned on throughout the investigation may indicate a Jinn, though this cannot be used as definite proof.

* Jinn cannot turn off the fuse box, but can still interact with light switches. Since turning on switches can cause the fuse box to shut off, this could lead players to conclude the ghost hit the breaker. If turning the fuse box back on does not cause the lights to come back on as before, then it was not shut off by a ghost and Jinn cannot be ruled out.

* Jinn is not affected by electronic devices and are not more likely to interact with them. This is misconception about the Jinn's abilities. Whether there are lights turned on or not also does not affect the Jinn's abilities.

## Mare	

🔮 Ghost Orb | 🔊 Spirit Box | 🖊️ Writing

### Abilities



* Mares have a chance of turning off a light source immediately if a player turns one on in the vicinity. 

### Activity

* Mares cannot turn on individual light switches, computer monitors, or TVs. and they are more likely to choose turning off lights as an interaction. 

* The Mare will have decreased interaction activity if its current room is lit.

* The Mare is more likely to perform light-shattering ghost events. Whether the lights are turned on or off do not affect the Mare's chance of performing this event. Where possible, avoid staying in rooms where you want the lights turned on, so that the Mare is less likely to shatter them.

* The Mare will prefer roaming into a dark room rather than lit rooms. If you have lights on in various rooms and the ghost roams away frequently, then it could be a Mare.

### Hunt Behaviour

* The Mare has a hunt sanity threshold of 60% if the lights in its room are off, and 40% if they are turned on. This applies even if the fuse box is turned off or broken.

### Identification Strategies

* The Mare is generally one of the more difficult ghosts to identify based on behaviour. The Mare's hunt threshold in light/dark rooms is one indicator, but this can be difficult to measure and unreliable. A preference for light-shattering ghost events is another indicator, but multiple instances of this event is not conclusive evidence of a Mare. 

* The Mare will prefer moving into dark rooms rather than lit rooms when roaming, so tracking the Mare's movements may be one method of identification. Setting up motion sensors near the ghost room and turning various lights on an off while checking occasionally to see if it changed rooms may help provide secondary evidence. 

* Turning lights off in areas near the ghost room and then setting up video cameras to see if the ghost is turning lights on anywhere in the investigation area may help in ruling out a Mare. The lack of these interactions isn't conclusive proof the ghost is a Mare, but can be strong evidence. Be cautious, however, since if it is a Mare, and the lights are left off in most of the house, then the sanity threshold for a hunt will be higher.

* Attempting to trigger the Mare's ability to turn a light back off the moment a player turns it on may be one conclusive method. Pausing a few seconds between turning the lights on will help with accurately identifying this ability. 

### False Positives

* Mares do not have any special behaviour regarding fuse boxes, and can turn them on or off. Mares do not turn the fuse box off more frequently than any other ghost.

* A ghost turning on the light directly eliminates the possibility of it being a Mare. On the other hand, any ghost may choose to never turn on a light throughout the entire game, so this negative should not be used to confirm the ghost type. In fact, any ghost may turn off a light immediately after you turn it on purely by chance. Ghost events do not count for this (Mare) ability.

* Spamming the light switch will not trigger this interaction, so this is best utilised with some time between switching the lights on/off. This interaction will give off an EMF 2 reading. Note that any ghost can do so purely by coincidence. Ghost events do not count for this ability.

## Mimic	

Fingerprints, Freezing Temperatures, Spirit Box

* The Mimic presents Ghost Orbs as a fourth "evidence." This will always be present even on a 0-evidence difficulty. Conclusively identifying two of The Mimic's main evidences plus Ghost Orbs in Nightmare difficulty confirms that the ghost is The Mimic. On the contrary, if you managed to obtain only one or two (depending on difficulty) of The Mimic's primary evidences and a Ghost Orb, be sure that the ghost doesn't give off another piece of evidence to safely rule out The Mimic.

* The Mimic has the ability to replicate other ghosts' abilities, such as the Obake's six-fingered handprint, or hunting sanity thresholds. This could be used against it if it presents an ability while also showing contradicting evidence (such as leaving a six-fingered handprint but creating freezing temperatures, which the Obake does not provide as evidence).

    * When turning into a Thaye, the Mimic will pick a random age. Inconsistent responses about age from a Thaye, could indicate a Mimic.
    
    * The Mimic cannot replicate the Goryo D.O.T.S. ability, because it cannot create D.O.T.S.


* The Mimic will occasionally change the ghost it decides to impersonate during the mission. This might betray The Mimic if the player notices the ghost demonstrating two completely different traits (such as noticing the ghost flickering slower like a Phantom during a hunt, when it was not doing so earlier). Note that the Mimic cannot switch ghosts during a hunt.

## Moroi

🔊 Spirit Box | 🌡️ Freezing | 🖊️ Writing

*Forced evidence:* 🔊Spirit Box.

### Abilities

The Moroi can curse a target when players hear them through the Spirit Box or Parabolic Microphone. When a player is cursed, their sanity drain doubles, and cannot be stopped by lights. The curse is paused temporarily when players are outside the investigation area, and Sanity Pills remove the curse for a player. Multiple players can be cursed at the same time, but they do not stack on a single player.

### Hunt Behaviour

* The Moroi's speed is dependent on the average sanity. It will speed up from 1.5 m/s % at 50% sanity to 2.25 m/s at 5% or below. The speed changes during a hunt according to the current average sanity. 

* Unlike most other ghosts with implicit speed bonuses, the Moroi accelerates with continuous line-of-sight of a player. Below 5% average sanity, the maximum speed of a Moroi is 3.71 m/s, faster than the Revenant's 3 m/s.

* Moroi cannot see nor kill players for 12 seconds when smudged during a hunt, twice as long as the usual 6 seconds.

### Identification Strategies

* After a player receives a spirit box response, keep track of the sanity of all players; if one person's sanity drops noticeably quicker than others, then it is likely a Moroi.

* The Moroi becomes faster as the average sanity becomes lower. If the ghost speeds up over several hunts, then it could be a Moroi. Note that the Hantu can speed up if the fuse box is off over several hunts, so ensure that the fuse box remains turned on.

* On Nightmare difficulty, after receiving a spirit box response, the questioner should immediately return to the van and consume sanity pills to reach maximum sanity, hold a lit candle going back in, then receive another response from the spirit box, wait about 30 seconds, then finally return to the van again and attempt to eat another sanity pill. If the player can eat a sanity pill (barring any ghost events or other abilities), then it is probably a Moroi. Some ghosts such as the Yurei or Jinn can drop the sanity of nearby players; try to eliminate this as a possibility.

If you notice the ghost moving fast while hunting, and you use pills while it's hunting and notice the ghost's speed suddenly drop, this could be evidence for a Moroi. 

### False Positives

* Because Moroi's speed increases as the player's sanity goes down, it can sometimes be mistaken for other fast moving ghosts such as a Thaye or Revenant.

* Because Moroi can damage the player's sanity very fast if it uses its curse ability, it can easily be mistaken for an early hunter despite only being able to hunt at 50%. 

# Myling	

### Unique Identifiers
* Mylings have quieter footsteps and vocalizations than other ghosts during a hunt. 

    * **Test:** Throw any electronic equipment on the ground next to the player and listen; if ghost sounds (excluding item/door touches) can only be heard within the range that electronics begin to flicker (about 10 meters), then the ghost may be a Myling. 
    * This test only applies when the ghost is on the same floor as the player. This test is also more favorable with a fair quality audio setup.

### Possible Identifiers
* Mylings have a higher chance to make sounds on Parabolic Mic, such as murmuring or growling. Evidence can be ambiguous though, so may be unreliable. 



## Obake
### Unique Identifiers
* Will always give ✋Fingerprints.


* There is a 16.7% chance that the Obake will leave a special fingerprint not seen with other ghosts. These consist of having six-fingered handprints instead of five, two fingerprints on light switches instead of one, and five fingerprints on keyboards and Prison cell block gates instead of four.


* During a hunt, there is a 1 in 15 (~6.67%) chance for the Obake to appear as a different ghost model every time it flickers visible. This will return to normal on the next flicker, and will happen at least once per hunt.


* Obake has a 25% chance to leave no fingerpeints when it interacts with a surface that allows for fingerprints.

* Obake may also use an ability that halves the remaining duration of existing fingerprints on the map, potentially causing them to disappear within seconds of appearing. 

### Tells
* If the ghost touches two different surfaces, and leaves fingerprints on one but not another (or the fingerprint disappears much quicker than 2 minutes after the touch), then it is an Obake.

### False Positives
* Obake can sometimes be mistaken for a Phantom. If playing against a female ghost model, there's a chance the Obake can use its transformation ability to transform from a model that is standing into one that is small or crawling on the floor. This can cause it to appear like the ghost is invisible for long periods during a hunt, and be mistaken for a Phantom. 

## Oni	
**Required Sanity:** Standard

**Speed:** Standard


### Unique Identifiers
* Oni will never appear as ball of mist during ghost event. 

* Oni will have shorter blinks during hunts and will remain mostly visible. 

### Possible Identifiers
* During ghost events, the Oni is more likely to use its full ghost model rather than a shadow or a translucent form.

* Onis will drain double the normal sanity amount during a ghost event (20% instead of 10%). Noticing a player that has witnessed one or more ghost events and experienced a higher sanity drop than expected is a good sign of an Oni.



## Onryo	
### Unique Identifiers
* Flames act like crucifix for Onryo (candles, lighter, Maple Lodge Campsite campfire). If Onryo tries to hunt with a flame source nearby, it will blow out the flame instead. 

* If Onryo tried to hunt with both a flame and a crucifix nearby, it will always favor blowing out flame. 

  * **Test:** Place a crucifix down, and having multiple lit candles in close proximity; if the candles repeatedly go out without the ghost ever hunting nor the crucifix ever burning, even at low average sanity, the ghost may be an Onryo. On the other hand, if the crucifix burns without any nearby candle being extinguished, the ghost is not an Onryo.

### Possible Identifiers
* The Onryo has a 60% hunt sanity threshold.

* Every third candle that the Onryo blows out will also cause it to hunt. This ability will trigger a hubt at any sanity. At high sanity, if the ghost hunts within a few seconds after blowing out your candle, then it could be an Onryo.

* Mimic can sometimes be mistaken for Onryo. Get fingerprints to rule out a Mimic.

### Ghost Hunt Conditions
* **Required Sanity:** 60% naturally; Blowing out three candles in a row will trigger a hunt; chance of hunt after blowing out candle goes up for each player who has died.

* **Speed:** Standard

## Phantom	

### Unique Identifiers

* Taking a photo of a Phantom will make it temporarily disappear for that specific instance that it appears. 

    * This will not stop a manifestation nor a hunt if one is already in progress. In a ghost event, if the ghost disappeared as the picture was taken but his footsteps and vocalizations can still be heard, it means that it is a Phantom.

    * **Test:** The ghost's physical image will not be visible in the picture found in the journal, but will be labelled as a "Ghost" picture. Additionally, the image will appear without any electronic interference. However, any ghost can have the same effect if the photo is taken right at the end of a ghost event; be sure that the ghost event is still ongoing even when the ghost has disappeared.

* During a hunt, a Phantom will flash visible every 1 to 2 seconds as opposed to every 0.3 to 1 seconds for other ghosts. 

    * **Test:** Watch for the ghost's flickering rate; if it is invisible for longer periods of time, it is a Phantom.

### Ghost Hunt Conditions
* **Required Sanity:** Standard

* **Speed:** Standard

### Possible Identifiers
* The Phantom has an ability similar to the Wraith's, which it can use (not during a manifestation) to walk to a random player's location regardless of distance. After this, the Phantom will continue normal activity. This is more useful on large maps; if the ghost interacts or hunts near a player who is very far from the ghost room, it could be a Phantom.

* Despite what the journal states, the Phantom does not drain sanity perceptibly quicker than other ghosts.

## Poltergeist	

### Unique Identifiers
* Poltergeists can throw multiple objects at once, which will decrease nearby players' sanity; the decrease is by 2% times the number of objects moved.

    * **Test:** Make a pile of multiple items. If the ghost moves/throws mutiple items at once, it's a Poltergeist. 

* During hunts, the Poltergeist has a 100% chance to throw an item in its path every 0.5 seconds, unlike other ghosts which only have a 50% chance of doing so. Noticing almost every prop the ghost passes being thrown with considerable strength is a strong sign of a Poltergeist.

### Possible Identifiers
* Poltergeists tend to throw objects more frequently than other ghosts.

* Poltergeists can throw objects with much more strength than other ghosts. Noticing items being "shot" across the room or items that seem to have been launched from far away (i.e, a dining utensil found across the living room from the nearby dining room) is a possible sign of a Poltergeist.

Poltergeists are more likely to throw objects, and have a 100% chance of interacting with objects during hunts, instead of 50%

    When throwing an object, it has a chance of throwing it with 2 - 6 power instead of 1 - 3 power
    Poltergeists also have an ability to throw all nearby items with this power

### Ghost Hunt Conditions
* **Required Sanity:** Standard

* **Speed:** Standard
# Raiju	
### Unique Identifiers
* If the Raiju is within 6-10 metres (depending on map size) of any active electronic equipment, its speed will be fixed to 2.5 m/s. Having a ghost that is moving quickly in the presence of electronics and even while not chasing someone may indicate that the ghost is a Raiju.


* During ghost events and hunts, the Raiju will interfere with electronics up to 15 metres away, compared to 10 metres for every other ghost. This distance only applies to electronics that are on the same floor as the ghost.


* On difficulties with 2 evidence (e.g. Nightmare), obtaining EMF Level 5 and Ghost Orbs confirms the ghost to be a Raiju, since the only other ghost that has these two evidences is the Obake, which has Fingerprints as a guaranteed evidence.

### Possible Identifiers
* *Sanity:* Raijus can hunt from an average sanity of 65% if there are active electronics near it.

# Revenant	
### Unique Identifiers
* Revenant will move noticably slower if it doesn't know the players location. If it knows the players location or can see the player, its speed will significantly increase. 

    * If player breaks LoS with Revenant, it will continue moving fast until it reaches the players last known location. If it doesn't see the player when it reaches their last known location, it will start to slow down again. 

    * Revenant will be able to detect you instantly if your flashlight is on or you speak. 

    * You can outrun a Revenant while sprinting but not walking. 

* You can tell a Revenant and Jinn apart because when the hunt begins, if out of LoS, a Revenant will move very slowly while a Jinn will be normal speed. 

### Ghost Hunt Conditions
* **Required Sanity:** Standard

* **Speed:** Very fast when it knowns the players location; very slow if it doesn't.
# Shade	
### Unique Identifiers
* Shade cannot hunt above 35%. 

* Shades will not perform interactions or hunt if there is a player in the same room. 

    * This ability may be bugged and throw false positives. 

    * It can still perform ghost writing while in the same room as one or more players. 

    * It is possible for the Shade to wander out of its room, before performing these actions.

### Possible Identifiers
* Shades have a lower success rate for ghost events. If the ghost performs a ghost event while average sanity is still high, then it is less likely (though not impossible) to be a Shade.

* Shades prefer airball ghost events over manifesting. 

* If it does manifest, it will prefer (though not always use) the shadow-type ghost form.

* If summoned by a Summoning Circle or a Music Box, the Shade has a chance of appearing as a shadow instead of a fully visible form while in the "ghost event" state.

### Ghost Hunt Conditions
* **Required Sanity:** 35%

* **Speed:** Standard
# Spirit	
### Unique Identifiers
* When smudged, spirits will not hunt for 180 seconds, as opposed to the standard 90 seconds. 

    * **Test:** When testing for a Spirit, ensure that your average sanity is below 50% by reading it off the sanity monitor, or checking that it has hunted (or attempted to hunt) at least once. Then, smudge the ghost and count for 180 seconds. If the ghost hunts within 90 to 180 seconds, then it is not a Spirit. If it only hunts after the 180 seconds are up, then it is likely a Spirit. 
    * To ensure that the smudge does not fail (causing the ghost to hunt much earlier than 90 seconds), wait for it to first use the crucifix, interact with an object, or use a motion sensor to locate it, then smudge the surrounding area.

### Ghost Hunt Conditions
* **Required Sanity:** Standard

* **Speed:** Will speed up briefly when in LoS.

# Thaye	


### Unique Identifiers

* The Thaye has an "age" parameter that decreases its general activity. Every 1 to 2 minutes, the Thaye attempts to age; if at least one player is in the same room as the ghost, the Thaye will age, else it will wait another 30 seconds before attempting to age again. The Thaye can age a total of 10 times per contract.

* Thaye will start off at 75% sanity required to hunt. This percentage will go down by 5% every time the Thaye ages until it reached 15% required sanity. 

* The Thaye does not speed up with line-of-sight of a player. 

* Over time, the age given when asked for via the Ouija Board will increase. The Thaye does not have to start from a "young" age human-wise.

### Possible Identifiers

* Thaye will tend to be much more active early on and then gradually become less active as the investigation goes on. 

* The Thaye is more likely to interact with the D.O.T.S Projector and Ghost Writing Book. If the ghost is slow to appear on the D.O.T.S Projector or give Ghost Writing, a Thaye is less likely.

### Strategies

* If the ghost is fast early in the contract, slows down over several hunts as players continue spending time near it, and does not gain speed with line-of-sight, then a Thaye is likely.

* On Nightmare difficulty, obtaining Ghost Writing and D.O.T.S Projector confirms the ghost as a Thaye, since the only other ghost that has these two evidences is the Deogen, which has Spirit Box as a guaranteed evidence.

## Twins	



### Unique Identifiers

* The Twins are one "real" ghost and one "decoy" ghost. 

* The Twins have a chance of interacting with the environment almost simultaneously; noticing two interactions occuring in very quick succession at two separate locations. 

    * This happening relatively frequently, is a very strong sign of The Twins. However, this may easily go unnoticed if players are strictly focused on investigating in or around the ghost room, as the decoy Twin could possibly be far away from the "main" Twin. Leaving an active EMF reader inside the ghost room while doing something else might potentially help players identify Twins if an interaction is noticed somewhere and the EMF reader is heard going off inside the ghost room at the same time.

* Each Twin has a different moving speed during hunts. The main Twin will be 10% slower than the standard ghost speed while the secondary Twin will be 10% faster. Noticing a subtle change in speed from one hunt to another might be an indicator of The Twins.

* The "main" Twin can provide all three pieces of evidence, while the "decoy" Twin can only give EMF Level 5, and cannot be detected with motion sensors. Noticing multiple disturbances far away from the ghost room but failing to get any response on the Spirit Box or reading any significant temperature drop in the vicinity is a likely indicator of the decoy Twin causing disturbances.

### Possible Identifiers

* Similarly, if there are motion sensors nearby, noticing interactions occuring in the area but without the motion sensor ever being set off is a potential sign that it is the decoy Twin.

* Note that interactions for all ghosts happen in a radius confined to the same floor. This means that any ghost could interact through the wall. Having two interactions at reasonably different times in adjacent rooms does not necessarily indicate that the ghost is The Twins.

* If Twins are suspected, searching around the building for items that have been displaced or thrown on the floor or lights that have been unexpectedly turned on far away from the ghost room might help narrow down the ghost type. Note that this is more useful before the ghost has had the chance to hunt; ghosts can throw objects during hunts, so be careful not to be misled.

* When The Twins attempt to initate a hunt, there is a 50% chance of it to occur at the main Twin, and a 50% chance for it to occur from the decoy Twin. This means that The Twins can hunt while they are far from one another. Noticing a hunt starting unusually far away from the ghost room or multiple hunts each occuring in vastly different locations might be a sign of The Twins.

* Crucifixes will only check for the main Twin when blocking hunts, regardless of which location the ghost is attempting to hunt from.

## Wraith	

### Unique Identifiers

* Wraiths will never step in salt, though they can walk over them without leaving any imprint. 

    * **Wraith Test:** If the ghost leaves an imprint in a salt pile, you can eliminate the Wraith.

    * Similarly, if the ghost never steps in salt after a long time, then it is likely for it to be a Wraith.

### Possible Identifiers

* Wraiths can teleport to a player outside hunts, generating an EMF Level 2 or 5 reading. If there is no other interaction nearby that would have caused an EMF 2/5 reading, it is possible that the ghost is a Wraith. If the ghost is suddenly in an area it isn't expected, such as far from the ghost room, it may be a Wraith.

# Yokai	

### Unique Identifiers

* While players are talking near the Yokai, its hunt sanity threshold will be increased to 80%, else it will have the normal 50% threshold.
    
### Possible Identifiers

* Continuously talking near a Yokai will increase the chance of interactions taking place.

* During hunts, a Yokai can only sense voices and electronics within a 2.5-meter range.

    * If ghost appears to lose track of the player easily during hunts, such as weird doubling back while kiting around car in garage, could indicate a Yokai.

    * If you use a Music Box to start a hunt and ghost starts to hunt from very close, could indicate a Yokai.


# Yurei	

### Unique Identifiers

* The Yurei can drop the sanity of all players within 7.5 meters by 15% while also closing a door sharply at the same time. 

    * Noticing a door sharply close from being fully open is a strong sign of a Yurei. This ability does not apply during events and hunts, and will not work if the ghost's current room has no door.

    * Ability is buggy, and typically only works correctly if door is half open and then is closed/opened all the way. 

    * Keep in mind that any ghost can close a door this way; the Yurei simply does it much more often because it is also part of its ability.

    * If this occurs on the exit door (without an event or a hunt), then it is definitely a Yurei.

### Possible Identifiers

* Using a smudge stick near the Yurei will prevent the ghost from wandering out of its ghost room for 90 seconds. 

    * Players can try placing a Motion Sensor at the doorway, and proceed to smudge the ghost. If the motion sensor is never set off by the ghost within the next 90 seconds, then the ghost could be a Yurei.
    * Very hard to test conclusively because its easy to mistake normal activity for this Yurei ability. 

### Ghost Hunt Conditions

* **Required Sanity:** Standard

* **Speed:** Standard

# Interactions
**Hunting at High Sanity**

Mare, Yokai, Onryo, Thaye and Demon can hunt above 50%. 

* Mares can hunt at 60% if player is in a room where no lights are on. 

* Yokai can hunt at 80% if a player speaks near it. 

* Onryi can hunt naturally at 60% and can hunt regardless of sanity after blowing out a candle three times. 

* Demon hunts at 70% naturally and has a chance to hunt at 100%.

Moroi can seem like its hunting early because it drains sanity so fast. 

**Won't Hunt**

Shade, Mare, Deogen, Thaye

The Shade can only hunt at 35%. The Mare can't hunt until 40% if the lights are on. 

**Fast Hunt Speed**

Jinn and Revenant both speed up when they see a player during a hunt. You can tell the difference because Revenant will move noticably slower when it doesn't know where the player is. Jinn also only speeds up when it sees the player whilw the breaker is on.  

Hantu moves faster in colder temps, such as in the ghost room, or outdoors while its snowing. However Hantu will not speed up when it has LoS of player and will stay the same speed if in a warm room. 

Deogen

Thaye

**Teleporting/Unpredictable Movements**

Banshee, Wraith, and Phantom have teleporting-like abilities. If you are using an EMF reader and suddenly get signals with no clear source, it may be one of these three. 

**Fuse Box**

* When the ghost turns off the fuse box this does not automatically set all the lights to off. If breaker goes off, and when you turn it back on all the lights come back on as before, then it was a ghost. If the lights all stay off after the fuse box is back on, then it was popped for having on too many lights. 

* Hantu will never turn the breaker on and has a much higher chance to turn it off. 

* Jinn will never turn the breaker off, and leaves an EMF signal at the breaker when using its ability. 

* Mare has no higher chance of interacting with the breaker than any other ghost. 

**Very little activity/No clear abilities**

Yurei's abilities are very ambiguous. Hard to rule out or identify without evidence. 

Shades are less active overall and typically will not be active around players. Check activity board for higher activity when players are outside the house. 

Goryo's evidence can be hard to get. Lack of clear evidence or distinct abilities may indicate a Goryo.

**Lights popping**

**Airball events**

**Doesn't speed up in LoS**
Thaye, Hantu

Ghost is staying very close to ghost room.

Ghost is going very far from ghost room.

Ghost is frequently changing rooms. 

Standing still during ghost events. 

Taking a form frequently during ghost event.

Turning lights on frequently.

Turning lights off frequently.

Hitting the fuse box often.

# Enviroment & Equipment

Technically, the following count as light sources, though it must be emphasised that some of these may not be bright enough to prevent passive sanity drain:

*     Building/location lights
*     Candles
*     Normal/strong flashlights
*     Televisions/computers

Some maps or areas of maps, such as (but not limited to) farmhouses, Sunny Meadows, or house basements, have a lower "native lighting level". This means that lights may not be as effective in preventing passive sanity drain compared to other maps such as suburban houses.

Some examples of situations that generally prevent passive sanity drain include (non-exhaustive):

    Standing under/near a bright light in small houses
        Simply standing in the same room with a light turned on will not prevent passive sanity drain if the spot the player is physically standing is not well lit enough.
    Holding a lit candle
    Standing a short distance in front of an active flatscreen TV

Some situations may or may not prevent passive sanity drain, depending on the "native lighting level" of the area:

    Pointing a strong flashlight at the player's head
    Crouching over a lit candle

Examples of situations that will not prevent passive sanity drain include:

    Holding a lit flashlight of any type
    Standing in the corner of the Grafton Farmhouse storage room, even when the room lights are turned on
    Standing in front of an active computer, even though it technically counts as a light source
    Turning up the game's brightness

Active drains

    When a player dies, all other living players will lose 15% sanity.
    Use of various cursed possessions.



Using the spirit box requires on-site lights in the favourite room light to be turned off, but not player-brought equipment light. The ghost will still give responses even with flashlights on or if there are candles burning in the room. This also applies for lights in adjacent rooms; the Spirit Box will still work even if doors are open or the "room" is not separated by a physical wall (such as the kitchen and the dining room on Bleasdale Farmhouse). 


Depending on the ambient weather, using a thermometer can be useful in locating the ghost. Ghosts lower the temperature of the room that they are currently in to a certain point, regardless of whether they are inside or outside.
Temperature ranges

Note: The temperature values below take into account how the thermometer reading fluctuates and are not exact conversions

Ghosts cool down the room that they are currently occupying. When a room is at its coldest, the temperature reading range on the thermometer will be as follows:

    Ghosts with Freezing Temperatures as evidence: −12°C to −6°C (12°F to 18°F)
    Ghosts without Freezing Temperatures as evidence:
        'Sunrise' weather: 5°C to 11°C (42.6°F to 48.6°F)
        'Clear' or 'Fog' weather: 3°C to 9°C (39°F to 45°F)
        All other weather types: 0°C to 6°C (33.6°F to 39.6°F)

At the start of the game, all rooms (including the ghost's current room) start at either the maximum possible temperature (if the fuse box starts on), or at their ambient temperatures (which depends on the weather). Hence, the first thing to do when using temperatures to look for the ghost is to turn on the fuse box, if not already.

Since temperatures will rise and fall slowly, one should wait at least a minute before looking for rooms with low temperatures. In addition, it may take a few minutes after the ghost leaves a room for it to no longer be freezing. Do not assume that the ghost is still in a room just because it is freezing.

After waiting for temperatures to change, check the temperature of the room:

    Less likely candidates for the ghost's current room:
        'Sunrise' weather: > 12°C (49.6°F)
        'Clear Skies' or 'Fog' weather: > 10°C (46°F)
        All other weather types: > 7°C (40.6°F)
    More likely candidates for the ghost's current room:
        'Sunrise' weather: < 11°C (48.6°F)
        'Clear Skies' or 'Fog' weather: < 9°C (45°F)
        All other weather types: < 6°C (39.6°F)

In outdoor rooms (such as on campsites), being able to discern "normal" and "abnormal" temperatures may be more difficult.

Lighting the campfire on Maple Lodge Campsite and Camp Woodwind will warm up the surrounding area (room). Other than this, turning on the generator will not affect temperatures in outdoor areas.
Thermometer usage

As the thermometer works like a ray gun and measures the temperature a certain distance in front of it or when it hits a solid object, pointing the thermometer at the floor beneath your feet is the best way to read the temperature of the room you are currently in, and helps in proper identification of the correct room. Also note that the thermometer has a delay of 2 seconds between readings, and a slightly longer delay before it updates to the current room's temperature; let the reading update at least 2 or 3 times per room before moving on. If the room temperature seems to be abnormal, read the temperature several more times before deciding to setup there. 



Ghost Orb

The live video feed on a video camera allows a player to find ghost orbs on the spot by carrying a video camera and watching the video feed. If a ghost orb appears inside a room, that room is guaranteed to be the favourite room. Occasionally, the ghost orb may drift into another room during its motion; the room can be further verified by seeing if the ghost orb changes its position within the room. Ghost orbs are generated when all players have loaded in, making it also possible to view them with a CCTV camera on larger maps even before any exit doors have been unlocked, if the camera happens to have a view of the favourite room.

On Professional or Nightmare difficulties, periodically verifying the location of ghost orbs helps players to determine whether the favourite room has changed, signalling the time to move the equipment. Note that Ghost Orbs is not always one of the ghost's evidences (or is hidden as an evidence on Nightmare difficulty), so be careful not to assume that the ghost is not in a particular room if there are no ghost orbs.

Parabolic Microphone

Using a parabolic microphone (also known as a paramic) may help to narrow down the ghost's location. It has a detection range of 30 metres' length and a 6 metre width, and can detect any sound caused by the ghost, including footsteps, whispers, and interactions with the environment. The paramic can even detect the room that the ghost is currently in, giving off a consistent reading, though the appearance of this reading itself appears to be inconsistent. Keep in mind that the paramic also reads sounds that could be caused by either a ghost or a player, such as doors being closed or objects being thrown. Spirit box static, and low-volume ambient sounds will also be read by the paramic.

Motion Sensor

Motion sensors can be used to track the ghost's movement, which can be useful to look for roaming patterns that can help setting up equipment more efficiently or locate the ghost's current position. Be aware of other players (including dead ones) that will also trigger motion sensors.

Smudge Sticks

The "Cleanse the area near the ghost with Smudge Sticks" completes when the smudge sticks effect applies within 6 metres of a ghost. After the ghost has already been located, this may be useful in verifying that the ghost is still nearby, and for a Yurei, will also help to limit its movement to its current room in the 90 seconds that the smudge sticks effect is active for. If this objective does not complete after using the smudge sticks, it may mean that the ghost is not near enough, and has moved away to another location (though this may still be within the room).

Sound Sensor

As sound sensors are limited by range, one can use them to see if the ghost is still in its room. Like the parabolic microphone, sound sensors can detect sounds through walls within its coverage area and provide feedback to the van of the sum of all sounds detected, allowing players to monitor activity from the safety of the van and verify its location. Sound sensors are used most efficiently by covering the favourite room and its immediate area. Note that just like the parabolic microphone, sound sensors can also pick up some player-made sounds.

Spirit Box

If the ghost has Spirit Box as one of its evidence, you can use this to identify its general location. The ghost will only respond through the spirit box if it is either in the same room as the player or within 3 metres. Thus, the spirit box can help to identify the ghost's current room, or its approximate location.

Although the spirit box can identify both the ghost's current room and its approximate location, using the spirit box and continuously walking from room to room may be a noisy and tiring task. Hence, the spirit box is generally used only after the room has already been found and its evidence has been confirmed.

# Generic Ghost

## Characteristics

* Each ghost in a contract has a unique identity including type, gender, name, age, length of death, shyness, and physical model.

* Ghost behavior, movement speed, hunting patterns, and activity are mostly based on the type of ghost, except for its response to the Spirit Box, which is randomly set.

* The ghost will spawn in a favorite room after an exit door is opened for the first time. If the exit door is not unlocked, the ghost cannot interact, initiate ghost events or hunts, but can still provide certain evidence.

* Ghosts can stand still, roam, interact with objects and doors, initiate ghost events or hunts, and use abilities.

* Ghosts cannot leave the investigation area, and cannot walk out of the exit doors.

* Ghosts can throw objects, manipulate doors, make Dirty Water appear in sinks, and present themselves in any form, but certain ghosts are more likely to exhibit certain behaviors or have unique abilities.

* Ghosts are usually invisible, appearing during ghost events and hunts.

* Electronic equipment malfunctions within a 10-meter radius during manifestations and hunts.

* If a player is within 10 meters of the ghost during a hunt, the player will hear their heartbeat.

* Ghosts lower the temperature of the room they are occupying to a certain point. Ghosts with Freezing Temperatures as evidence cool the room to −12°C to −6°C (12°F to 18°F); those without freezing temperatures cool the room to different temperatures depending on the weather.


## Interactions

* Ghost events and hunts do not count as interactions, but ghosts can interact with the environment during both.

* Ghosts can interact with handheld objects, doors, windows, and switches, emitting an EMF 2 or 3 reading for 20 seconds, with a 25% chance of EMF 5 if the ghost has EMF Level 5 evidence.

* Most ghosts can interact with objects up to 3 meters away and through walls, with props thrown with a power of 1-3.

* During hunts, ghosts have a 50% chance of throwing a nearby prop every 0.5 seconds and can interact with doors at a different rate.

* The chance of interaction can be increased by playing on lower difficulties, customizing the ghost's interaction rate, cleansing the area near the ghost with smudge sticks, saying phrases recognized by the game, or using cursed objects.

* Interactions can be forced by using a Voodoo Doll or drawing a tarot card labeled The Tower.

* Interactions are not affected by the sanity level, and ghosts cannot throw items if the lights in their current room are on.

* All ghosts can interact with the fuse box remotely, but they must be within 3 metres to interact with its door.

* Interactions occur at a varying rate of approximately 1 - 3 per minute, which may depend on the ghost type. Interactions can help to pinpoint the ghost's current location, but not necessarily its current room or favourite room since ghosts can interact through walls.


## Ghost events

* When a player is within 10 meters of the ghost in the investigation area, the ghost may randomly trigger a ghost event that creates an EMF 4 reading.

* Certain activities, such as those during a hunt, dimming of lights, and candle burnouts, are not considered ghost events.

* Ghost events can be triggered by drawing The Devil card from a deck of Tarot Cards.


## Sanity

* Individual sanity fluctuates by up to ±2%, and displayed average sanity fluctuates by up to ±2% times the number of players.

* Lower average sanity increases the frequency of ghost events, hunts, and flickering lights.

* Passive sanity drain is affected by the amount of light surrounding the player's head.

* Playing solo will halve the rate of sanity drain.

* Light sources like building/location lights, candles, normal/strong flashlights, and televisions/computers may prevent passive sanity drain.

* Some maps have a lower "native lighting level," making lights less effective in preventing passive sanity drain.

* When a player dies, all other living players lose 15% sanity.


## Ghost Hunt

* Closet and locker doors do not share the same mechanic with regular doors, and ghosts are more likely to open them when passing by.

* Ghosts can open closet and locker doors at random, giving them a chance to establish line-of-sight and kill the player before they close the door.

* After a hunt, there is a 25-second cooldown before the ghost can initiate another hunt (except for cursed hunts)

* Ghosts can initiate hunts once the average sanity is at or below 50%. Cursed hunts can only be initiated by using cursed possessions and ignore hunt sanity thresholds and cooldowns

* Ghosts cannot teleport during hunts, but they can wander in a random direction or chase a player.

* Ghosts have access to practically all places that players can access within the investigation area. They can phase through certain furniture, but cannot physically enter closets, lockers, and mini-tents.

* In a wandering phase, ghosts randomly select a waypoint on the map and attempt to take the shortest path to reach it. If they detect a player, they will enter a chasing phase and set a waypoint at the player's last known location.

* During a hunt, the ghost will remember the last detected location of a player before the hunt ended, and it has a 50% chance to set a waypoint at this location when a new hunt starts. The ghost can only remember one waypoint per hunt, and it cannot detect the player through other methods if it is considered to be on a different floor.

* The ghost's vision is 360 degrees, and most physical objects or structures will block the line of sight, except for some small or thin furniture.

* Ghosts can hear players up to 9 meters away and on the same floor during a hunt, and any sound above a certain volume will attract them if voice chat is activated. Players using global chat within 9 meters of the ghost will also attract it.

* The ghost will be attracted to any active electronic equipment within 7.5 meters of it on the same floor during a hunt, but equipment dropped on the floor or offhand, as well as Head Mounted Cameras, do not attract the ghost.

* Footsteps, door, closet, and locker noises, electronics on the floor or turned off, crucifixes, lit smudge sticks, candles and glowsticks (even when lit), and players outside the investigation area do not attract the ghost.

* All ghosts have a 50% chance (100% chance for Poltergeist) of throwing one object near it every 0.5 seconds during hunts.

* Ghosts cannot write in Ghost Writing Book during hunts but can throw it.

* Ghosts can interact with all types of doors, except exit doors and other types of furniture doors. If a ghost with the Fingerprints evidence interacts with a door, it will leave fingerprints accordingly.

* Ghosts cannot override a normal or closed door unless it detects the player, but it can still leave EMF signal and fingerprints.

* Ghosts will interact with small tent doors if a player is detected inside.

* Ghosts can perform a D.O.T.S. Projector interaction, allowing the silhouette to appear if D.O.T.S. Projector is one of its evidences.

* Ghosts can produce footsteps and vocalizations during hunts, with the interval between footsteps depending on the ghost's moving speed. The range of hearing is 20 metres (12 metres for Myling).

* Within 10 metres of the ghost (15 metres for Raiju), all active electronic equipment and map lights will malfunction or flicker rapidly, and players can hear their own heartbeat.

* During a hunt, the ghost will flicker or flash in and out of existence, with a visibility length between 0.08 to 0.3 seconds and an invisibility length between 0.3 to 1 seconds.

* To kill a player, the ghost must intersect with their collision box and achieve line-of-sight. The dead player will drop all equipment and be teleported to an otherworldly room with the ghost before returning to their location with their screen covered in fog.

* A hunt ends when the ghost kills a player, the ghost's hunting time is up, or all players die. The ghost will disappear and be teleported back to its ghost room, and all on-site lights will turn off and can once again be toggled.

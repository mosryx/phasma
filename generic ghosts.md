# Generic Ghost

## Characteristics

* Each ghost in a contract has a unique identity including type, gender, name, age, length of death, shyness, and physical model.

* The ghost will spawn in a favorite room after an exit door is opened for the first time. If the exit door is not unlocked, the ghost cannot interact, initiate ghost events or hunts, but can still provide certain evidence.

* Electronic equipment malfunctions within a 10-meter radius during manifestations and hunts.

* If a player is within 10 meters of the ghost during a hunt, the player will hear their heartbeat.

* Ghosts lower the temperature of the room they are occupying to a certain point. Ghosts with Freezing Temperatures as evidence cool the room to −12°C to −6°C (12°F to 18°F); those without freezing temperatures cool the room to different temperatures depending on the weather.

## Interactions

* Ghosts can interact with handheld objects, doors, windows, and switches, emitting an EMF 2 or 3 reading for 20 seconds, with a 25% chance of EMF 5 if the ghost has EMF Level 5 evidence.

* Most ghosts can interact with objects up to 3 meters away and through walls, with props thrown with a power of 1-3.

* During hunts, ghosts have a 50% chance of throwing a nearby prop every 0.5 seconds and can interact with doors at a different rate.

* The chance of interaction can be increased by playing on lower difficulties, customizing the ghost's interaction rate, cleansing the area near the ghost with smudge sticks, saying phrases recognized by the game, or using cursed objects.

* Interactions can be forced by using a Voodoo Doll or drawing a tarot card labeled The Tower.

* Interactions are not affected by the sanity level, and ghosts cannot throw items if the lights in their current room are on.

* All ghosts can interact with the fuse box remotely, but they must be within 3 metres to interact with its door.

* Interactions occur at a varying rate of approximately 1 - 3 per minute, which may depend on the ghost type. Interactions can help to pinpoint the ghost's current location, but not necessarily its current room or favourite room since ghosts can interact through walls.


## Ghost events

* When a player is within 10 meters of the ghost in the investigation area, the ghost may randomly trigger a ghost event that creates an EMF 4 reading.

## Sanity

* Lower average sanity increases the frequency of ghost events, hunts, and flickering lights.

* Passive sanity drain is affected by the amount of light surrounding the player's head.

* Playing solo will halve the rate of sanity drain.

* Light sources like building/location lights, candles, normal/strong flashlights, and televisions/computers may prevent passive sanity drain.

* Some maps have a lower "native lighting level," making lights less effective in preventing passive sanity drain.



## Ghost Hunt

* Closet and locker doors do not share the same mechanic with regular doors, and ghosts are more likely to open them when passing by.

* Ghosts can open closet and locker doors at random, giving them a chance to establish line-of-sight and kill the player before they close the door.

* After a hunt, there is a 25-second cooldown before the ghost can initiate another hunt (except for cursed hunts)

* Ghosts can initiate hunts once the average sanity is at or below 50%. Cursed hunts can only be initiated by using cursed possessions and ignore hunt sanity thresholds and cooldowns

* Ghosts cannot teleport during hunts, but they can wander in a random direction or chase a player.

* Ghosts have access to practically all places that players can access within the investigation area. They can phase through certain furniture, but cannot physically enter closets, lockers, and mini-tents.

* In a wandering phase, ghosts randomly select a waypoint on the map and attempt to take the shortest path to reach it. If they detect a player, they will enter a chasing phase and set a waypoint at the player's last known location.

* During a hunt, the ghost will remember the last detected location of a player before the hunt ended, and it has a 50% chance to set a waypoint at this location when a new hunt starts. The ghost can only remember one waypoint per hunt, and it cannot detect the player through other methods if it is considered to be on a different floor.

* The ghost's vision is 360 degrees, and most physical objects or structures will block the line of sight, except for some small or thin furniture.

* Ghosts can hear players up to 9 meters away and on the same floor during a hunt, and any sound above a certain volume will attract them if voice chat is activated. Players using global chat within 9 meters of the ghost will also attract it.

* The ghost will be attracted to any active electronic equipment within 7.5 meters of it on the same floor during a hunt, but equipment dropped on the floor or offhand, as well as Head Mounted Cameras, do not attract the ghost.

* Footsteps, door, closet, and locker noises, electronics on the floor or turned off, crucifixes, lit smudge sticks, candles and glowsticks (even when lit), and players outside the investigation area do not attract the ghost.

* All ghosts have a 50% chance (100% chance for Poltergeist) of throwing one object near it every 0.5 seconds during hunts.

* Ghosts cannot write in Ghost Writing Book during hunts but can throw it.

* Ghosts can interact with all types of doors, except exit doors and other types of furniture doors. If a ghost with the Fingerprints evidence interacts with a door, it will leave fingerprints accordingly.

* Ghosts cannot override a normal or closed door unless it detects the player, but it can still leave EMF signal and fingerprints.

* Ghosts will interact with small tent doors if a player is detected inside.

* Ghosts can perform a D.O.T.S. Projector interaction, allowing the silhouette to appear if D.O.T.S. Projector is one of its evidences.

* Ghosts can produce footsteps and vocalizations during hunts, with the interval between footsteps depending on the ghost's moving speed. The range of hearing is 20 metres (12 metres for Myling).

* Within 10 metres of the ghost (15 metres for Raiju), all active electronic equipment and map lights will malfunction or flicker rapidly, and players can hear their own heartbeat.

* During a hunt, the ghost will flicker or flash in and out of existence, with a visibility length between 0.08 to 0.3 seconds and an invisibility length between 0.3 to 1 seconds.

* To kill a player, the ghost must intersect with their collision box and achieve line-of-sight. The dead player will drop all equipment and be teleported to an otherworldly room with the ghost before returning to their location with their screen covered in fog.

* A hunt ends when the ghost kills a player, the ghost's hunting time is up, or all players die. The ghost will disappear and be teleported back to its ghost room, and all on-site lights will turn off and can once again be toggled.

## Abilities


## Activity



## Hunt Behavior



Most of its general behaviour (such as movement speed, hunting patterns, activity etc.) is based on the type of ghost, except for its willingness to respond to the spirit box in the presence of multiple people in the room, which is randomly set. 

For all ghosts, if the target for most ghost events (not to be confused with a Banshee target) collides with the ghost or smoke ball, causing it to disappear, that player loses 10% of their sanity. 

During hunts, the ghost will materialise itself and proceed to roam around the location in order to kill one or more players. For the duration of the hunt, lights in the ghost's current room will flicker, all exit doors will become locked, and the ghost will cause all nearby electronic equipment to malfunction. 

Once a hunt ends, there is a minimum cooldown of 25 seconds before the ghost can attempt to initiate another hunt. This does not affect cursed hunts. Ghosts do not necessarily hunt immediately once this cooldown is over. 

For most ghosts, the average team sanity is used to determine whether the ghost can hunt. The average sanity is of all players who are alive, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the investigation area. Dead players do not count towards the average team sanity.

For most ghosts, the hunt sanity threshold is 50%; ghosts can initiate hunts at random once the average sanity is at or below 50%. Every few seconds, the game has a chance to check for the required sanity value, then rolls a probability to decide whether to hunt. The probability increases at lower sanities; hunts occur more often at lower average sanities. 

At the point that the ghost attempts to initiate a hunt, if a crucifix is within 3 metres of the ghost (5 metres for a Demon), the hunt will fail. Each time a crucifix is used, the ghost must wait 25 seconds (20 seconds for a Demon) before attempting to initiate a hunt again. Each crucifix can prevent a hunt 2 times before becoming useless.

Lighting smudge sticks near the ghost will prevent it from attempting to initiate further hunts for 60 seconds for a Demon, 180 seconds for a Spirit, and 90 seconds for all other ghosts.

The ghost cannot detect or see players during this grace period.

Hunts always initiate from wherever the ghost is standing (except for The Twins in specific cases); it does not have to start from any specific room. Once the grace period begins, an EMF 4 signal will be emitted at the point where the ghost is standing. 

Once the grace period ends, the ghost will proceed to either wander in a random direction, or chase a player. Ghosts cannot teleport during hunts. 

The ghost's vision is 360 degrees.
There is no maximum distance at which the ghost can see the player.
Most physical objects or structures, excluding throwables or certain types of furniture that are thin or small, will block LoS. For example, this includes glass windows and doors, and cell walls and doors in Prison.

During a hunt, ghosts can hear players up to 9 metres away and on the same floor.

Whether the ghost can hear the player is dictated by their voice chat settings. When voice chat is activated, any sound above a certain volume, whether from the player talking or background noise, will attract the ghost within the specified distance.

Using global chat within 9 metres of the ghost, even without talking, will attract it to the player using it. This does not attract the ghost to other players; players outside the investigation area using global chat will not cause players inside to die.
		
		
For comparison, the normal electronic interference range is 10 metres.

Voice communication and electronic detection are similar in terms of detection priority. If the ghost is considered to be on a different floor from the player, the ghost can only detect the player through LoS. Otherwise, the ghost will not be able to detect the player through other methods.

The following do not attract the ghost:

    Footsteps;
    Door, closet and locker noises;
    Electronics on the floor, even when turned on;
    Electronics that are held and turned off;
    Crucifixes;
    Lit smudge sticks;
    Candles and glowsticks, even when lit;
    Players outside the investigation area (except Deogen in some cases).
		
If the ghost is within 6 metres of any player while a smudge stick is burning, regardless of who is holding the smudge stick, and is successfully "pinged", the ghost will be unable to detect or kill players for 6 seconds, and be put into a "wandering" phase. When the effect ends, it will be able to detect and kill players again, resuming its normal hunting behaviour. The smudge stick technically does not "repel" the ghost away from the player, only that it will randomly set a new waypoint which may or may not be in the same direction as the player. 


Most ghosts move at a base speed of 1.7 m/s.[3] If the ghost has active line-of-sight (LoS) with a player it is chasing, its speed will gradually increase over time, capped at 1.65 times its base speed. With continuous LoS, ghosts will take approximately 10-15 seconds to reach this maximum speed from base speed.[verification needed] If it loses detection of a player, its speed will slowly decrease back to base speed (at a rate much slower than its acceleration) once it has given up the "immediate area search". Ghosts do not carry over their speed across hunts. 


Ghosts have a chance of changing favourite room when performing long roams, and each singular roam has a maximum path distance of 10 metres.

    A ghost can realistically change from the Dining Room in Tanglewood to the Master Bedroom in one roam.
    A ghost in the Foyer of Bleasdale Farmhouse would have to minimally change favourite rooms to the Upstairs Hallway first, before possibly changing to the Attic.
    A ghost in the A/B blocks of Prison would find it very hard to change rooms to the front section of the map, since the intermediate hallway cannot be chosen as a favourite room.

However, ghosts such as the Wraith, Phantom, and Banshee can go to a player anywhere on the map, and hence have a higher chance of changing favourite rooms. Otherwise, in general, the further a room is from the ghost('s current favourite room), the lower the chance is of the ghost changing its favourite room to there. 



In general, most ghosts (including Wraiths) cannot see players through doors or walls. However, during hunts, all ghosts can pass through doors as if they didn't exist. 

The ghost's vision is unaffected by darkness, and they can see players in the dark just as well as they can in the light. Conversely, ghosts do not actually "see" the light beam from a flashlight, instead sensing it as with other active electronic equipment, nor can they see the light emitted by any other type of equipment, electronic or non-electronic. 




Unlike ghost events and hunts, interactions are not directly affected by sanity.[1] Instead, having the lights turned on in rooms where the ghost is present will make it less likely to interact, which incidentally may reduce the player's sanity drain as they stay in the light more, hence giving the impression that lower sanity increases activity. 

Ghosts can interact with a variety of items, including handheld objects, doors, windows and switches. Each interaction causes an EMF 2 or 3 reading emitted at the point of interaction for 20 seconds, depending on the type of interaction. If the ghost has EMF Level 5 as one of its evidences, each individual reading has a 25% chance to be EMF 5 instead. Subsequently, when touching surfaces or switches, the relevant ghosts may also leave fingerprints on them.

Most ghosts can interact with objects that are up to 3 metres away. Ghosts can interact with objects through walls. Props (not fixed objects such as doors) are thrown with a "power" of 1 - 3.

During hunts, ghosts have a 50% chance of throwing a nearby prop every 0.5 seconds. Ghosts can also interact with doors during hunts, though at a different rate.

The chance of an interaction can be increased through the following:

    Playing on a lower difficulty
    Customizing the ghost's interaction rate on the Custom Difficulty settings
    Cleansing the area near the ghost with smudge sticks
    Saying phrases that are recognised by the game, such as its name or questions
        This has a cooldown of 10 seconds, the player must be near the ghost, and only increases the chance of interactions in general
    Forcing an interaction through cursed objects



Every time a map is loaded in, an area will be randomly selected to be the favourite room. The favourite room is relevant for the following behaviour:

    The ghost will spawn in the favourite room at the start of the contract.
    The ghost will teleport to the favourite room at the end of every hunt.
    The ghost will roam back to the room after certain conditions are satisfied.
    Ghost Orbs, if the ghost has the evidence, will be present in only the favourite room.
    The Haunted Mirror will show a view of the favourite room.
    The Hermit tarot card will teleport the ghost to the favourite room and temporarily trap it there.
		
		
Three criteria are used to determine whether the favourite room will change. If the ghost performs a 'long roam' and ends up in a room that is not its current favourite room, the ghost will perform a chance roll based on the Changing favourite room difficulty setting:

    None (Amateur, Intermediate): 0%
    Low (Professional): 33%
    Medium (Nightmare): 66%
    High (Insanity): 100%

If the chance above succeeds, a second chance roll is performed on the complement of the average sanity (or insanity); for example, an average sanity of 80% has a 20% chance of succeeding. If both chances are successful, the favourite room will change to the ghost's current room. 


In most cases, ghosts can interact with items that are up to 3 metres away of its current position. The exceptions (relevant for this section) are:

    All ghosts can interact with the fuse box remotely (i.e. turn off or on).
        However, ghosts must be within 3 metres of the fuse box to interact with its door (if applicable).
				
Visual and audio clues

One way to identify interactions is to silently walk around and look carefully for sounds produced by the ghost or objects being out of place. For example:
Visual and audio

    Doors being unexpectedly opened or closed, or seen being moved without anyone nearby. The sound produced by a ghost when touching a door is distinct from the sound that players cause
    A faucet (i.e. Dirty Water) or shower running
    An item being thrown or hitting the floor/being out of place, like food utensils or paintings being on the floor
    Car alarms, televisions, or computers being turned on
    Light switches being turned on/off, or being unexpectedly turned on
    Fans rumbling
    A piano key being pressed
    A rocking chair rocking
    Sunny Meadows - Crosses found hung on walls being turned upside down
    Sunny Meadows - Metronomes being turned on.
    Sunny Meadows - Alarm clocks being turned on.
		
Audio only

    Phones ringing
    Radios (not player walkie-talkies) being turned on
    Teddy bears laughing/giggling
    Window knocks
    Guitars being strummed

Visual only

    Mannequins being rotated or teleported; the location where the mannequin was teleported from is where the ghost was
    Teddy bear head being turned
    Teddy bear/bunny/ball being teleported
		
		
		
All interactions generate an EMF reading that lasts 20 seconds, so once you hear or see something, use the reader to identify which item it was. 



Ghosts lower the temperature of the room that they are currently in to a certain point, regardless of whether they are inside or outside.
Temperature ranges

Note: The temperature values below take into account how the thermometer reading fluctuates and are not exact conversions

Ghosts cool down the room that they are currently occupying. When a room is at its coldest, the temperature reading range on the thermometer will be as follows:

    Ghosts with Freezing Temperatures as evidence: −12°C to −6°C (12°F to 18°F)
    Ghosts without Freezing Temperatures as evidence:
        'Sunrise' weather: 5°C to 11°C (42.6°F to 48.6°F)
        'Clear' or 'Fog' weather: 3°C to 9°C (39°F to 45°F)
        All other weather types: 0°C to 6°C (33.6°F to 39.6°F)

At the start of the game, all rooms (including the ghost's current room) start at either the maximum possible temperature (if the fuse box starts on), or at their ambient temperatures (which depends on the weather). Hence, the first thing to do when using temperatures to look for the ghost is to turn on the fuse box, if not already.

Since temperatures will rise and fall slowly, one should wait at least a minute before looking for rooms with low temperatures. In addition, it may take a few minutes after the ghost leaves a room for it to no longer be freezing. Do not assume that the ghost is still in a room just because it is freezing.

After waiting for temperatures to change, check the temperature of the room:

    Less likely candidates for the ghost's current room:
        'Sunrise' weather: > 12°C (49.6°F)
        'Clear Skies' or 'Fog' weather: > 10°C (46°F)
        All other weather types: > 7°C (40.6°F)
    More likely candidates for the ghost's current room:
        'Sunrise' weather: < 11°C (48.6°F)
        'Clear Skies' or 'Fog' weather: < 9°C (45°F)
        All other weather types: < 6°C (39.6°F)

In outdoor rooms (such as on campsites), being able to discern "normal" and "abnormal" temperatures may be more difficult.

Lighting the campfire on Maple Lodge Campsite and Camp Woodwind will warm up the surrounding area (room). Other than this, turning on the generator will not affect temperatures in outdoor areas. 



Without adjusting for volume fall-off, the maximum distance a player can hear ghost footsteps and vocalisations during a hunt is 20 metres (12 metres for Myling). If the player(s) and the ghost are located on different floors during the hunt, there will be no electronic interference and the ghost's footsteps and vocalisations will be greatly muffled, though the range is still the same. Sound occlusion and electronic interference does not account for walls and staircases: a ghost going up a staircase may sound muffled and not cause electronic interference on the upper floor until it reaches the top, for example.

Within 10 metres of the ghost (15 metres for Raiju), all active electronic equipment and map lights will malfunction and/or flicker rapidly. Players can hear their own heartbeat if the ghost is within 10 metres, and there are no walls, floors, or doors between the ghost and the player. Furniture does not prevent heartbeats even when the ghost technically does not have line-of-sight with the player.

During a hunt, the ghost will flicker or flash in and out of existence, with a visibility length between 0.08 to 0.3 seconds, and an invisibility length between 0.3 to 1 seconds. The first flicker-in occurs immediately when the grace period ends. Some ghosts have different flickering behaviours:

    The Phantom's invisibility length is between 1 to 2 seconds.
    The Deogen's invisibility length is lower than 0.3 to 1 second.
    The Oni's visibility length is longer than 0.08 to 0.3 seconds.
    The Obake has a 1 in 15 (~6.67%) chance per flicker-in of appearing as a different ghost model. This will return to its normal model on the next flicker-in, and is guaranteed to happen at least once per hunt.

Taken correctly, one can obtain rewardable ghost photos during a hunt while the ghost flashes visible.

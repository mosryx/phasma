## Hunting at high sanity



The **Banshee** checks for their target's sanity when trying to initiate a hunt, instead of the team's average sanity. This means that the Banshee can appear to hunt from as early as 87.5% average sanity, depending on the target's sanity and number of other players.




## Not hunting at low sanity


The **Banshee** checks for their target's sanity when trying to initiate a hunt, instead of the team's average sanity. This means that the Banshee can appear to hunt from as low as 12.5% average sanity, depending on the target's sanity and number of other players.





## Very active



## Low activity



## Fast hunt speed



## Slow hunt speed



## Doesn't accelerate in LoS



## Erratic hunt speeds




## Unpredictable movements/teleporting around map

When the **Banshee** performs a roam, it has a 2/3 chance to roam to its target's location if they are inside the investigation area. These only occur outside of hunts and leaves no EMF reading. 


## No clear abilities or traits




## Ghost is staying very close to ghost room.






## Ghost is going very far from ghost room.

**Banshees** tend to wander towards their target outside of hunts. If a player is reporting frequent activity or even hunts starting near them and far away from the ghost room they may be a Banshee's target.



## Ghost is frequently changing rooms. 



## Standing still during ghost events. 



## Taking a form frequently during ghost event.



## Turning lights on frequently.



## Turning lights off frequently.



## Hitting the fuse box often.



## Lights popping



## Airball events



## Mostly invisible during hunt/long blinks



## Mostly visible during hunt/short blinks



## Random EMF readings w/o clear origin


The Banshee's ability to roam to its target's location does *not* leave an EMF reading, and cannot produce this effect. 



## Strange sounds on spirit box/parabolic mic


When a Parabolic Microphone is used, the **Banshee** has a 33% chance of making a unique shriek-like paranormal sound instead of a whisper or footstep.




## Sanity dropping quickly

The **Banshee** can drop a player's sanity by 15% if the player walks toward it while it performs a signing event.

**Hunting at High Sanity**

Mare, Yokai, Onryo, Thaye and Demon can hunt above 50%. 

* Mares can hunt at 60% if player is in a room where no lights are on. 

* Yokai can hunt at 80% if a player speaks near it. 

* Onryi can hunt naturally at 60% and can hunt regardless of sanity after blowing out a candle three times. 

* Demon hunts at 70% naturally and has a chance to hunt at 100%.

Moroi can seem like its hunting early because it drains sanity so fast. 

**Won't Hunt**

Shade, Mare, Deogen, Thaye

The Shade can only hunt at 35%. The Mare can't hunt until 40% if the lights are on. 

**Fast Hunt Speed**

Jinn and Revenant both speed up when they see a player during a hunt. You can tell the difference because Revenant will move noticably slower when it doesn't know where the player is. Jinn also only speeds up when it sees the player whilw the breaker is on.  

Hantu moves faster in colder temps, such as in the ghost room, or outdoors while its snowing. However Hantu will not speed up when it has LoS of player and will stay the same speed if in a warm room. 

Deogen

Thaye

Moroi

**Teleporting/Unpredictable Movements**

Banshee, Wraith, and Phantom have teleporting-like abilities. If you are using an EMF reader and suddenly get signals with no clear source, it may be one of these three. 

**Fuse Box**

* When the ghost turns off the fuse box this does not automatically set all the lights to off. If breaker goes off, and when you turn it back on all the lights come back on as before, then it was a ghost. If the lights all stay off after the fuse box is back on, then it was popped for having on too many lights. 

* Hantu will never turn the breaker on and has a much higher chance to turn it off. 

* Jinn will never turn the breaker off, and leaves an EMF signal at the breaker when using its ability. 

* Mare has no higher chance of interacting with the breaker than any other ghost. 



**Very little activity/No clear abilities**

Yurei's abilities are very ambiguous. Hard to rule out or identify without evidence. 

Shades are less active overall and typically will not be active around players. Check activity board for higher activity when players are outside the house. 

Goryo's evidence can be hard to get. Lack of clear evidence or distinct abilities may indicate a Goryo.


**Doesn't speed up in LoS**
Thaye, Hantu

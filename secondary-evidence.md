## Hunting at high sanity

The **Banshee** checks for their target's sanity when trying to initiate a hunt, instead of the team's average sanity. This means that the Banshee can appear to hunt from as early as 87.5% average sanity, depending on the target's sanity and number of other players.

The **Mare** has a hunt sanity threshold of 60% if the lights are off in its current room when it initiates a hunt. This applies even if the fuse box is turned off or broken.

The **Demon** has a hunt sanity threshold of 70%, and has a chance to hunt at any sanity.

The **Yokai** can hunt at 80% sanity when players are talking within a 2.5-meter range. Otherwise it hunts at the standard threshold.

**Onryo** hunts at 60% sanity, and can hunt at any sanity if it blows out three flames and is not otherwise prevented. 

**Raiju** can hunt at 65% sanity when its within range of electrical equipment. 

## Not hunting at low sanity

The **Banshee** checks for their target's sanity when trying to initiate a hunt, instead of the team's average sanity. This means that the Banshee can appear to hunt from as low as 12.5% average sanity, depending on the target's sanity and number of other players.

The **Mare** has a hunt sanity threshold of 40% if the lights are on in its current room when it initiates a hunt. This applies even if the fuse box is turned off or broken.

Flames prevent **Onryo** from hunting in the same way a crucifix does for generic ghosts. 

## Sanity dropping quickly

The **Banshee** can drop a player's sanity by 15% if the player walks toward it while it performs a signing event.

Being within 10 meters of a **Phantom** while in pseudo line-of-sight during ghost events and hunts will reduce the player's sanity by 0.5%/s.

The **Jinn** has an ability to instantly decrease the sanity of all players in the same room or otherwise within 3 metres by 25% if the fuse box is on. This will give an EMF reading at the fuse box.

The **Oni** will drain double the sanity (20%) of other ghosts when colliding with the target player during a ghost event.

## Fast hunt speed

The **Jinn** can move at 2.5 m/s during a hunt if it sees a player until it gets within 3 meters. It can only use this ability if the fuse box is on. If the Jinn gets within 3 meters of the player, doesn't see the player, or if the breaker is off, the Jinn will move at standard ghost speeds.

The **Revenant** will move at 3 m/s if it knows the players location or can see the player. Otherwise it will move at 1 m/s.

The **Hantu's** speed during a hunt is tied to tempuratures, moving faster the colder it gets. It's speed can range from 1.4 m/s at the warmest tempuratures, to 2.75 m/s at freezing tempuratures.

The **Twins** have an increased hunt speed when it initiates a hunt from the location of the "decoy" twin, moving at 1.9 m/s. 

The **Raiju** hunts at a base speed of 2.5 m/s while within range of electrical equipment. It also recieves the LoS bonus when close to a player, which stacks with its base speed bonus if active. 

### Key Terms

- LoS Bonus
- Initiating a hunt
- Base Speed

## Unpredictable movements/teleporting around map

When the **Banshee** performs a roam, it has a 2/3 chance to roam to its target's location if they are inside the investigation area. These only occur outside of hunts and leaves no EMF reading.

The **Phantom** has an ability where it will choose a random player and travel to their location, creating an EMF Level 2 reading where it started its walk.

The **Twins** can interact with objects up to 16 meters away, leaving behind an EMF signature, which on smaller maps can appear like it is teleporting. 

## No clear abilities or traits

The **Spirit** has almost no unique traits. It is a generic ghost except that when smudged it cannot hunt for 180 seconds instead of 90 seconds.

The **Yurei's** abilities can often appear ambiguous, and be mistaken for normal ghost behavior. Must test specifically for its abilities.

Because **Obake** has a 1/4 chance to leave no fingerprint evidence after an interaction, and due to its ability to reduce the shelf life of all fingerprints on the map by half, its possible players may never find fingerprint evidence at all. If players have trouble finding a final piece of evidence, then Obake may be reason. 

## Very active

The **Poltergeist** tends to be more active in general, and will tend toward throwing items.

The **Oni** will be more active on average, interacting with objects more often, especially when there are people in the ghost room.

The **Yokai** will be more active when players are talking while near it.

## Ghost is staying very close to ghost room.

The **Mare** will prefer roaming into a dark room rather than lit rooms. If you have lights on in rooms near the ghost room and the ghost is staying in the ghost room with the lights off, then it could be a Mare.

The **Goryo** can only travel up to 5 meters during a roam, and cannot change its ghost room at any point regardless of difficulty.

## Ghost is going very far from ghost room.

**Banshees** tend to wander towards their target outside of hunts. If a player is reporting frequent activity or even hunts starting near them and far away from the ghost room they may be a Banshee's target.

The **Mare** will prefer roaming into a dark room rather than lit rooms. If you have lights on in various rooms and the ghost roams away frequently, then it could be a Mare.

## Low activity

The **Mare** will have decreased interaction activity if the room it is currently in is lit.

The **Shade** is generally less active than most ghosts. It cannot perform ghost events at all at 100% average sanity, with the success rate increasing as the average goes down. It cannot perform any interactions when it's in the same room as another player (except ghostwriting).

## Slow hunt speed

The **Revenant** will move at 1 m/s if it doesn't know the players location or can't see the player. Otherwise it will move at 3 m/s.

The **Twins** have a decreased hunt speed when it initiates a hunt from the location of the "real" twin, moving at 1.5 m/s. 

## Doesn't accelerate in LoS

The **Jinn** will move at a speed of 2.5 m/s if it has LoS on a player while the fuse box is on during a hunt. However, when it gets within 3 meters of the player, it returns to standard speeds.

The **Hantu** will not accelerate when it has LoS on the player. However, in cases where the player is looking the Hantu for instance, it may still gain speed, as the room's tempurature changes the longer it is in it.

## Erratic hunt speeds

The **Jinn** will move at a speed of 2.5 m/s if it has LoS on a player while the fuse box is on during a hunt. However, when it gets within 3 meters of the player, it returns to standard speeds.

The **Hantu's** speed during a hunt is tied to tempuratures, moving faster the colder it gets. As it moves between colder and warmer areas it's speed may noticably change.

The **Twins** hunt speed will vary between hunts depending on where the hunt initiates from, either the location of its "real" twin or its "decoy." 

The **Raiju's** base speed increases to 2.5 m/s when its within range of active electrical equipment. While moving around the investigation area, passing into and out of range of equipment can cause it to sound like it is speeding up and slowing down. 

## Ghost is frequently changing rooms.

## Standing still during ghost events.

## Taking a form frequently during ghost event.

The **Oni** prefers to manifest in full form and will never appear as ball of mist during ghost event. It can still perform events that can cause a hiss, such as "fake hunt" type manifestations.

## Not taking a form during ghost events/prefers airball events

The **Shade** prefers manifesting as mist during ghost events, and when it does take a form prefers the shadow person form.

## Turning lights on frequently.

If a ghost turns on a light switch, computer, or TV screen on, then it **cannot** be a Mare.

## Turning lights off frequently.

The **Mare** has a chance of turning off a light source immediately if a player turns one on in the vicinity. It also is unable to turn a light switch on.

## Hitting the fuse box often.

If the ghost is turning off the fuse box frequently, then it likely is **not** a Jinn.

A **Hantu** is twice as likely as other ghosts to turn off the breaker. It is unable to turn the breaker on.

## Lights shattering ghost events

The **Mare** is more likely to perform light-shattering ghost events. Whether the lights are turned on or off do not affect the Mare's chance of performing this event.

## Mostly invisible during hunt/long blinks

The **Phantom** will flash visible every 1 to 2 seconds as opposed to every 0.3 to 1 seconds for other ghosts.

## Mostly visible during hunt/short blinks

The **Oni** will flash visible for longer than most other ghosts during a hunt.

## Random EMF readings w/o clear origin

The Banshee's ability to roam to its target's location does *not* leave an EMF reading, and **cannot** produce this effect.

The **Phantom** has an ability where it will choose a random player and travel to their location, creating an EMF Level 2 reading where it started its walk.

The **Twins** has a "real" twin and a "decoy" which have an interaction range of 3 meters and 16 meters respectively. While the "real" twin behaves normally, the "decoy" does not set off motion sensors and leaves no evidence except EMF reading (can be as high as EMF 5). 

## Strange sounds on spirit box/parabolic mic

When a Parabolic Microphone is used, the **Banshee** has a 33% chance of making a unique shriek-like paranormal sound instead of a whisper or footstep.

The **Myling** is more likely to produce frequent paranormal sounds, which can be heard through a Parabolic Microphone.

**Hunting at High Sanity**

Mare, Yokai, Onryo, Thaye and Demon can hunt above 50%.

* Mares can hunt at 60% if player is in a room where no lights are on.
* Yokai can hunt at 80% if a player speaks near it.
* Onryi can hunt naturally at 60% and can hunt regardless of sanity after blowing out a candle three times.
* Demon hunts at 70% naturally and has a chance to hunt at 100%.

Moroi can seem like its hunting early because it drains sanity so fast.

**Won't Hunt**

Shade, Mare, Deogen, Thaye

The Shade can only hunt at 35%. The Mare can't hunt until 40% if the lights are on.

**Fast Hunt Speed**

Jinn and Revenant both speed up when they see a player during a hunt. You can tell the difference because Revenant will move noticably slower when it doesn't know where the player is. Jinn also only speeds up when it sees the player whilw the breaker is on.

Hantu moves faster in colder temps, such as in the ghost room, or outdoors while its snowing. However Hantu will not speed up when it has LoS of player and will stay the same speed if in a warm room.

Deogen

Thaye

Moroi

**Teleporting/Unpredictable Movements**

Banshee, Wraith, and Phantom have teleporting-like abilities. If you are using an EMF reader and suddenly get signals with no clear source, it may be one of these three.

**Fuse Box**

* When the ghost turns off the fuse box this does not automatically set all the lights to off. If breaker goes off, and when you turn it back on all the lights come back on as before, then it was a ghost. If the lights all stay off after the fuse box is back on, then it was popped for having on too many lights.
* Hantu will never turn the breaker on and has a much higher chance to turn it off.
* Jinn will never turn the breaker off, and leaves an EMF signal at the breaker when using its ability.
* Mare has no higher chance of interacting with the breaker than any other ghost.

**Very little activity/No clear abilities**

Yurei's abilities are very ambiguous. Hard to rule out or identify without evidence.

Shades are less active overall and typically will not be active around players. Check activity board for higher activity when players are outside the house.

Goryo's evidence can be hard to get. Lack of clear evidence or distinct abilities may indicate a Goryo.

**Doesn't speed up in LoS**
Thaye, Hantu

**Hunting at High Sanity**

Mare, Yokai, Onryo, Thaye and Demon can hunt above 50%. 

* Mares can hunt at 60% if player is in a room where no lights are on. 

* Yokai can hunt at 80% if a player speaks near it. 

* Onryi can hunt naturally at 60% and can hunt regardless of sanity after blowing out a candle three times. 

* Demon hunts at 70% naturally and has a chance to hunt at 100%.

Moroi can seem like its hunting early because it drains sanity so fast. 

**Won't Hunt**

Shade, Mare, Deogen, Thaye

The Shade can only hunt at 35%. The Mare can't hunt until 40% if the lights are on. 

**Fast Hunt Speed**

Jinn and Revenant both speed up when they see a player during a hunt. You can tell the difference because Revenant will move noticably slower when it doesn't know where the player is. Jinn also only speeds up when it sees the player whilw the breaker is on.  

Hantu moves faster in colder temps, such as in the ghost room, or outdoors while its snowing. However Hantu will not speed up when it has LoS of player and will stay the same speed if in a warm room. 

Deogen

Thaye

**Teleporting/Unpredictable Movements**

Banshee, Wraith, and Phantom have teleporting-like abilities. If you are using an EMF reader and suddenly get signals with no clear source, it may be one of these three. 

**Fuse Box**

* When the ghost turns off the fuse box this does not automatically set all the lights to off. If breaker goes off, and when you turn it back on all the lights come back on as before, then it was a ghost. If the lights all stay off after the fuse box is back on, then it was popped for having on too many lights. 

* Hantu will never turn the breaker on and has a much higher chance to turn it off. 

* Jinn will never turn the breaker off, and leaves an EMF signal at the breaker when using its ability. 

* Mare has no higher chance of interacting with the breaker than any other ghost. 

**Very little activity/No clear abilities**

Yurei's abilities are very ambiguous. Hard to rule out or identify without evidence. 

Shades are less active overall and typically will not be active around players. Check activity board for higher activity when players are outside the house. 

Goryo's evidence can be hard to get. Lack of clear evidence or distinct abilities may indicate a Goryo.

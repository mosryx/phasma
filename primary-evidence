## Spirit Box

Using the spirit box requires on-site lights in the favourite room light to be turned off, but not player-brought equipment light. The ghost will still give responses even with flashlights on or if there are candles burning in the room. This also applies for lights in adjacent rooms; the Spirit Box will still work even if doors are open or the "room" is not separated by a physical wall (such as the kitchen and the dining room on Bleasdale Farmhouse). 

Spirit Box evidence can be obtained by asking the ghost questions while using the equipment.

To use the Spirit Box, the player must be in the same room as the ghost or within 3 meters of it if not in the same room.

All ambient lighting in the room must be off for the Spirit Box to work, but adjacent rooms do not need their lights disabled.
Ghosts who only respond to "people who are alone" will only respond if there is only one player in the room.

If the above conditions are met, the ghost will have a chance to respond.

Ghosts in the game "Phasmaphobia" can be identified by their behavior and characteristics.

The Spirit Box is a piece of electronic equipment used to communicate with ghosts.

The Spirit Box will return one of two results: a ghost icon and a corresponding voice response if all conditions are met or an 'X' icon if one or more conditions are not met.

The Spirit Box will work anywhere on the map, but for a successful response, the player must be in the investigation area and meet certain conditions.

To get a successful Spirit Box response from the ghost, the ghost must have Spirit Box as one of its evidences, the player must be in the investigation area, within 3 meters of the ghost, and the lights in the player's current room must be off.

Ghosts that respond only to "people who are alone" will only respond if there is a single person in the room at the moment the question is asked.

If all conditions are met, there is a 2/3 chance of the ghost responding per question asked.

The Spirit Box is considered electronic equipment and may flicker if interfered with.

Holding an active Spirit Box within 7.5 meters of a ghost on the same floor will attract the ghost to the player.

The ghost touching a door or an object, performing a ghost event or a hunt, or repeatedly saying certain words is not evidence of Spirit Box.

The ghost may still respond audibly if the player asks questions while the Spirit Box is being interfered with, but this is separate from the vocalizations that the ghost may produce during ghost events or hunts.

## D.O.T.S. Projector

The D.O.T.S Projector emits a matrix of bright green laser points in a small area from the projector, which can be mounted on the wall or floor.

If the ghost's evidence includes D.O.T.S Projector, and the ghost is within 7 meters on the same floor, the ghost will occasionally interact with the projector, and a mesh-like figure representative of the ghost model will appear running or crawling through the grid.

The appearance of the figure through the D.O.T.S Projector is not related to the actual motion of the ghost, but only indicates the ghost's proximity to the projector.

Dead players cannot see the ghost pass through the D.O.T.S. Projector.
The D.O.T.S Projector is not activated when held and will not attract the ghost to the player during a hunt.

Placing one or two D.O.T.S projectors around the center of the ghost's favorite room will cover most of the area that the ghost will move around. If the room is very small, consider placing the projector just outside that room instead and monitoring it from there.

The silhouette seen through the D.O.T.S Projector can be clearer and more developed when viewed through a video camera with night vision on and lights in the room turned off.

The Projector emits a substantial amount of light when placed, which can be used for radial area illumination, but the green light emitted may obscure nearby fingerprints or footprints.

The particle effect produced by a ghost stepping in salt can be confused with D.O.T.S, so be careful when checking for fingerprints.

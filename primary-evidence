Using the spirit box requires on-site lights in the favourite room light to be turned off, but not player-brought equipment light. The ghost will still give responses even with flashlights on or if there are candles burning in the room. This also applies for lights in adjacent rooms; the Spirit Box will still work even if doors are open or the "room" is not separated by a physical wall (such as the kitchen and the dining room on Bleasdale Farmhouse).

## Spirit Box

Using the spirit box requires on-site lights in the favourite room light to be turned off, but not player-brought equipment light. The ghost will still give responses even with flashlights on or if there are candles burning in the room. This also applies for lights in adjacent rooms; the Spirit Box will still work even if doors are open or the "room" is not separated by a physical wall (such as the kitchen and the dining room on Bleasdale Farmhouse). 

Spirit Box evidence can be obtained by asking the ghost questions while using the equipment.

To use the Spirit Box, the player must be in the same room as the ghost or within 3 meters of it if not in the same room.

All ambient lighting in the room must be off for the Spirit Box to work, but adjacent rooms do not need their lights disabled.
Ghosts who only respond to "people who are alone" will only respond if there is only one player in the room.

If the above conditions are met, the ghost will have a chance to respond.

Ghosts in the game "Phasmaphobia" can be identified by their behavior and characteristics.

The Spirit Box is a piece of electronic equipment used to communicate with ghosts.

The Spirit Box will return one of two results: a ghost icon and a corresponding voice response if all conditions are met or an 'X' icon if one or more conditions are not met.

The Spirit Box will work anywhere on the map, but for a successful response, the player must be in the investigation area and meet certain conditions.

To get a successful Spirit Box response from the ghost, the ghost must have Spirit Box as one of its evidences, the player must be in the investigation area, within 3 meters of the ghost, and the lights in the player's current room must be off.

Ghosts that respond only to "people who are alone" will only respond if there is a single person in the room at the moment the question is asked.

If all conditions are met, there is a 2/3 chance of the ghost responding per question asked.

The Spirit Box is considered electronic equipment and may flicker if interfered with.

Holding an active Spirit Box within 7.5 meters of a ghost on the same floor will attract the ghost to the player.

The ghost touching a door or an object, performing a ghost event or a hunt, or repeatedly saying certain words is not evidence of Spirit Box.

The ghost may still respond audibly if the player asks questions while the Spirit Box is being interfered with, but this is separate from the vocalizations that the ghost may produce during ghost events or hunts.

## D.O.T.S. Projector

The D.O.T.S Projector emits a matrix of bright green laser points in a small area from the projector, which can be mounted on the wall or floor.

If the ghost's evidence includes D.O.T.S Projector, and the ghost is within 7 meters on the same floor, the ghost will occasionally interact with the projector, and a mesh-like figure representative of the ghost model will appear running or crawling through the grid.

The appearance of the figure through the D.O.T.S Projector is not related to the actual motion of the ghost, but only indicates the ghost's proximity to the projector.

Dead players cannot see the ghost pass through the D.O.T.S. Projector.
The D.O.T.S Projector is not activated when held and will not attract the ghost to the player during a hunt.

Placing one or two D.O.T.S projectors around the center of the ghost's favorite room will cover most of the area that the ghost will move around. If the room is very small, consider placing the projector just outside that room instead and monitoring it from there.

The silhouette seen through the D.O.T.S Projector can be clearer and more developed when viewed through a video camera with night vision on and lights in the room turned off.

The Projector emits a substantial amount of light when placed, which can be used for radial area illumination, but the green light emitted may obscure nearby fingerprints or footprints.

The particle effect produced by a ghost stepping in salt can be confused with D.O.T.S, so be careful when checking for fingerprints.

# Enviroment & Equipment

Technically, the following count as light sources, though it must be emphasised that some of these may not be bright enough to prevent passive sanity drain:

*     Building/location lights
*     Candles
*     Normal/strong flashlights
*     Televisions/computers

Some maps or areas of maps, such as (but not limited to) farmhouses, Sunny Meadows, or house basements, have a lower "native lighting level". This means that lights may not be as effective in preventing passive sanity drain compared to other maps such as suburban houses.

Some examples of situations that generally prevent passive sanity drain include (non-exhaustive):

    Standing under/near a bright light in small houses
        Simply standing in the same room with a light turned on will not prevent passive sanity drain if the spot the player is physically standing is not well lit enough.
    Holding a lit candle
    Standing a short distance in front of an active flatscreen TV

Some situations may or may not prevent passive sanity drain, depending on the "native lighting level" of the area:

    Pointing a strong flashlight at the player's head
    Crouching over a lit candle

Examples of situations that will not prevent passive sanity drain include:

    Holding a lit flashlight of any type
    Standing in the corner of the Grafton Farmhouse storage room, even when the room lights are turned on
    Standing in front of an active computer, even though it technically counts as a light source
    Turning up the game's brightness

Active drains

    When a player dies, all other living players will lose 15% sanity.
    Use of various cursed possessions.






Depending on the ambient weather, using a thermometer can be useful in locating the ghost. Ghosts lower the temperature of the room that they are currently in to a certain point, regardless of whether they are inside or outside.
Temperature ranges

Note: The temperature values below take into account how the thermometer reading fluctuates and are not exact conversions

Ghosts cool down the room that they are currently occupying. When a room is at its coldest, the temperature reading range on the thermometer will be as follows:

    Ghosts with Freezing Temperatures as evidence: −12°C to −6°C (12°F to 18°F)
    Ghosts without Freezing Temperatures as evidence:
        'Sunrise' weather: 5°C to 11°C (42.6°F to 48.6°F)
        'Clear' or 'Fog' weather: 3°C to 9°C (39°F to 45°F)
        All other weather types: 0°C to 6°C (33.6°F to 39.6°F)

At the start of the game, all rooms (including the ghost's current room) start at either the maximum possible temperature (if the fuse box starts on), or at their ambient temperatures (which depends on the weather). Hence, the first thing to do when using temperatures to look for the ghost is to turn on the fuse box, if not already.

Since temperatures will rise and fall slowly, one should wait at least a minute before looking for rooms with low temperatures. In addition, it may take a few minutes after the ghost leaves a room for it to no longer be freezing. Do not assume that the ghost is still in a room just because it is freezing.

After waiting for temperatures to change, check the temperature of the room:

    Less likely candidates for the ghost's current room:
        'Sunrise' weather: > 12°C (49.6°F)
        'Clear Skies' or 'Fog' weather: > 10°C (46°F)
        All other weather types: > 7°C (40.6°F)
    More likely candidates for the ghost's current room:
        'Sunrise' weather: < 11°C (48.6°F)
        'Clear Skies' or 'Fog' weather: < 9°C (45°F)
        All other weather types: < 6°C (39.6°F)

In outdoor rooms (such as on campsites), being able to discern "normal" and "abnormal" temperatures may be more difficult.

Lighting the campfire on Maple Lodge Campsite and Camp Woodwind will warm up the surrounding area (room). Other than this, turning on the generator will not affect temperatures in outdoor areas.
Thermometer usage

As the thermometer works like a ray gun and measures the temperature a certain distance in front of it or when it hits a solid object, pointing the thermometer at the floor beneath your feet is the best way to read the temperature of the room you are currently in, and helps in proper identification of the correct room. Also note that the thermometer has a delay of 2 seconds between readings, and a slightly longer delay before it updates to the current room's temperature; let the reading update at least 2 or 3 times per room before moving on. If the room temperature seems to be abnormal, read the temperature several more times before deciding to setup there. 



Ghost Orb

The live video feed on a video camera allows a player to find ghost orbs on the spot by carrying a video camera and watching the video feed. If a ghost orb appears inside a room, that room is guaranteed to be the favourite room. Occasionally, the ghost orb may drift into another room during its motion; the room can be further verified by seeing if the ghost orb changes its position within the room. Ghost orbs are generated when all players have loaded in, making it also possible to view them with a CCTV camera on larger maps even before any exit doors have been unlocked, if the camera happens to have a view of the favourite room.

On Professional or Nightmare difficulties, periodically verifying the location of ghost orbs helps players to determine whether the favourite room has changed, signalling the time to move the equipment. Note that Ghost Orbs is not always one of the ghost's evidences (or is hidden as an evidence on Nightmare difficulty), so be careful not to assume that the ghost is not in a particular room if there are no ghost orbs.

Parabolic Microphone

Using a parabolic microphone (also known as a paramic) may help to narrow down the ghost's location. It has a detection range of 30 metres' length and a 6 metre width, and can detect any sound caused by the ghost, including footsteps, whispers, and interactions with the environment. The paramic can even detect the room that the ghost is currently in, giving off a consistent reading, though the appearance of this reading itself appears to be inconsistent. Keep in mind that the paramic also reads sounds that could be caused by either a ghost or a player, such as doors being closed or objects being thrown. Spirit box static, and low-volume ambient sounds will also be read by the paramic.
After finding the ghost (room)

Motion Sensor

Motion sensors can be used to track the ghost's movement, which can be useful to look for roaming patterns that can help setting up equipment more efficiently or locate the ghost's current position. Be aware of other players (including dead ones) that will also trigger motion sensors.

Smudge Sticks

The "Cleanse the area near the ghost with Smudge Sticks" completes when the smudge sticks effect applies within 6 metres of a ghost. After the ghost has already been located, this may be useful in verifying that the ghost is still nearby, and for a Yurei, will also help to limit its movement to its current room in the 90 seconds that the smudge sticks effect is active for. If this objective does not complete after using the smudge sticks, it may mean that the ghost is not near enough, and has moved away to another location (though this may still be within the room).

Sound Sensor

As sound sensors are limited by range, one can use them to see if the ghost is still in its room. Like the parabolic microphone, sound sensors can detect sounds through walls within its coverage area and provide feedback to the van of the sum of all sounds detected, allowing players to monitor activity from the safety of the van and verify its location. Sound sensors are used most efficiently by covering the favourite room and its immediate area. Note that just like the parabolic microphone, sound sensors can also pick up some player-made sounds.

Spirit Box

If the ghost has Spirit Box as one of its evidence, you can use this to identify its general location. The ghost will only respond through the spirit box if it is either in the same room as the player or within 3 metres. Thus, the spirit box can help to identify the ghost's current room, or its approximate location.

Although the spirit box can identify both the ghost's current room and its approximate location, using the spirit box and continuously walking from room to room may be a noisy and tiring task. Hence, the spirit box is generally used only after the room has already been found and its evidence has been confirmed.
